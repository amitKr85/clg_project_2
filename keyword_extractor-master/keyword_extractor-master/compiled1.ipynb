      "data mining  is the process of discovering patterns in large data sets involving methods at the intersection of machine learning, statistics, and database systems.[1] data mining is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and statistics with an overall goal to extract information (with intelligent methods) from a data set and transform the information into a comprehensible structure for further use.[1][2][3][4] data mining is the analysis step of the \"knowledge discovery in databases\" process, or kdd.[5] aside from the raw analysis step, it also involves database and data management aspects, data pre-processing, model and inference considerations, interestingness metrics, complexity considerations, post-processing of discovered structures, visualization, and online updating.[1] the difference between data analysis and data mining is that data analysis is used to test models and hypotheses on the dataset, e.g., analyzing the effectiveness of a marketing campaign, regardless of the amount of data; in contrast, data mining uses machine-learning and statistical models to uncover clandestine or hidden patterns in a large volume of data.[6]\n",
      "the term \"data mining\" is in fact a misnomer, because the goal is the extraction of patterns and knowledge from large amounts of data, not the extraction (mining) of data itself.[7] it also is a buzzword[8] and is frequently applied to any form of large-scale data or information processing (collection, extraction, warehousing, analysis, and statistics) as well as any application of computer decision support system, including artificial intelligence (e.g., machine learning) and business intelligence. the book data mining: practical machine learning tools and techniques with java[9] (which covers mostly machine learning material) was originally to be named just practical machine learning, and the term data mining was only added for marketing reasons.[10] often the more general terms (large scale) data analysis and analytics – or, when referring to actual methods, artificial intelligence and machine learning – are more appropriate.\n",
      "the actual data mining task is the semi-automatic or automatic analysis of large quantities of data to extract previously unknown, interesting patterns such as groups of data records (cluster analysis), unusual records (anomaly detection), and dependencies (association rule mining, sequential pattern mining). this usually involves using database techniques such as spatial indices. these patterns can then be seen as a kind of summary of the input data, and may be used in further analysis or, for example, in machine learning and predictive analytics. for example, the data mining step might identify multiple groups in the data, which can then be used to obtain more accurate prediction results by a decision support system. neither the data collection, data preparation, nor result interpretation and reporting is part of the data mining step, but do belong to the overall kdd process as additional steps.\n",
      "the related terms data dredging, data fishing, and data snooping refer to the use of data mining methods to sample parts of a larger population data set that are (or may be) too small for reliable statistical inferences to be made about the validity of any patterns discovered. these methods can, however, be used in creating new hypotheses to test against the larger data populations.\n",

      "to communicate information clearly and efficiently, data visualization uses statistical graphics, plots, information graphics and other tools. numerical data may be encoded using dots, lines, or bars, to visually communicate a quantitative message.[2] effective visualization helps users analyze and reason about data and evidence. it makes complex data more accessible, understandable and usable. users may have particular analytical tasks, such as making comparisons or understanding causality, and the design principle of the graphic (i.e., showing comparisons or showing causality) follows the task. tables are generally used where users will look up a specific measurement, while charts of various types are used to show patterns or relationships in the data for one or more variables.\n",
      "data visualization is both an art and a science.[3] it is viewed as a branch of descriptive statistics by some, but also as a grounded theory development tool by others. increased amounts of data created by internet activity and an expanding number of sensors in the environment are referred to as \"big data\" or internet of things. processing, analyzing and communicating this data present ethical and analytical challenges for data visualization.[4] the field of data science and practitioners called data scientists help address this challenge.[5]\n",

      "data mining  is the process of discovering patterns in large data sets involving methods at the intersection of machine learning, statistics, and database systems.[1] data mining is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and statistics with an overall goal to extract information (with intelligent methods) from a data set and transform the information into a comprehensible structure for further use.[1][2][3][4] data mining is the analysis step of the \"knowledge discovery in databases\" process, or kdd.[5] aside from the raw analysis step, it also involves database and data management aspects, data pre-processing, model and inference considerations, interestingness metrics, complexity considerations, post-processing of discovered structures, visualization, and online updating.[1] the difference between data analysis and data mining is that data analysis is used to test models and hypotheses on the dataset, e.g., analyzing the effectiveness of a marketing campaign, regardless of the amount of data; in contrast, data mining uses machine-learning and statistical models to uncover clandestine or hidden patterns in a large volume of data.[6]\n",
      "the term \"data mining\" is in fact a misnomer, because the goal is the extraction of patterns and knowledge from large amounts of data, not the extraction (mining) of data itself.[7] it also is a buzzword[8] and is frequently applied to any form of large-scale data or information processing (collection, extraction, warehousing, analysis, and statistics) as well as any application of computer decision support system, including artificial intelligence (e.g., machine learning) and business intelligence. the book data mining: practical machine learning tools and techniques with java[9] (which covers mostly machine learning material) was originally to be named just practical machine learning, and the term data mining was only added for marketing reasons.[10] often the more general terms (large scale) data analysis and analytics – or, when referring to actual methods, artificial intelligence and machine learning – are more appropriate.\n",
      "the actual data mining task is the semi-automatic or automatic analysis of large quantities of data to extract previously unknown, interesting patterns such as groups of data records (cluster analysis), unusual records (anomaly detection), and dependencies (association rule mining, sequential pattern mining). this usually involves using database techniques such as spatial indices. these patterns can then be seen as a kind of summary of the input data, and may be used in further analysis or, for example, in machine learning and predictive analytics. for example, the data mining step might identify multiple groups in the data, which can then be used to obtain more accurate prediction results by a decision support system. neither the data collection, data preparation, nor result interpretation and reporting is part of the data mining step, but do belong to the overall kdd process as additional steps.\n",
      "the related terms data dredging, data fishing, and data snooping refer to the use of data mining methods to sample parts of a larger population data set that are (or may be) too small for reliable statistical inferences to be made about the validity of any patterns discovered. these methods can, however, be used in creating new hypotheses to test against the larger data populations.\n",

      "the database management system (dbms) is the software that interacts with end users, applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze the data.  the dbms software additionally encompasses the core facilities provided to administer the database.  the sum total of the database, the dbms and the associated applications can be referred to as a \"database system\".  often the term \"database\" is also used to loosely refer to any of the dbms, the database system or an application associated with the database.\n",
      "computer scientists may classify database-management systems according to the database models that they support. relational databases became dominant in the 1980s. these model data as rows and columns in a series of tables, and the vast majority use sql for writing and querying data.  in the 2000s, non-relational databases became popular, referred to as nosql because they use different query languages.\n",

      "a hospital is a health care institution providing patient treatment with specialized medical and nursing staff and medical equipment.[1] the best-known type of hospital is the general hospital, which typically has an emergency department to treat urgent health problems ranging from fire and accident victims to a sudden illness. a district hospital typically is the major health care facility in its region, with a large number of beds for intensive care and additional beds for patients who need long-term care. specialized hospitals include trauma centers, rehabilitation hospitals, children's hospitals, seniors' (geriatric) hospitals, and hospitals for dealing with specific medical needs such as psychiatric treatment (see psychiatric hospital) and certain disease categories. specialized hospitals can help reduce health care costs compared to general hospitals.[2] hospitals are classified as general, specialty, or government depending on the sources  of income received.\n",
      "a teaching hospital combines assistance to people with teaching to medical students and nurses. the medical facility smaller than a hospital is generally called a clinic. hospitals have a range of departments (e.g. surgery and urgent care) and specialist units such as cardiology. some hospitals have outpatient departments and some have chronic treatment units. common support units include a pharmacy, pathology, and radiology.\n",
      "hospitals are usually funded by the public sector, health organisations (for profit or nonprofit), health insurance companies, or charities, including direct charitable donations. historically, hospitals were often founded and funded by religious orders, or by charitable individuals and leaders.[3]\n",
      "currently, hospitals are largely staffed by professional physicians, surgeons, nurses, and allied health practitioners, whereas in the past, this work was usually performed by the members of founding religious orders or by volunteers. however, there are various catholic religious orders, such as the alexians and the bon secours sisters that still focus on hospital ministry in the late 1990s, as well as several other christian denominations, including the methodists and lutherans, which run hospitals.[4] in accordance with the original meaning of the word, hospitals were originally \"places of hospitality\", and this meaning is still preserved in the names of some institutions such as the royal hospital chelsea, established in 1681 as a retirement and nursing home for veteran soldiers.\n",
      "during the middle ages, hospitals served different functions from modern institutions. middle ages hospitals were almshouses for the poor, hostels for pilgrims, or hospital schools. the word \"hospital\" comes from the latin hospes, signifying a stranger or foreigner, hence a guest. another noun derived from this, hospitium came to signify hospitality, that is the relation between guest and shelterer, hospitality, friendliness, and hospitable reception. by metonymy the latin word then came to mean a guest-chamber, guest's lodging, an inn.[5] hospes is thus the root for the english words host (where the p was dropped for convenience of pronunciation) hospitality, hospice, hostel and hotel. the latter modern word derives from latin via the ancient french romance word hostel, which developed a silent s, which letter was eventually removed from the word, the loss of which is signified by a circumflex in the modern french word hôtel. the german word 'spital' shares similar roots.\n",
      "the grammar of the word differs slightly depending on the dialect. in the united states, hospital usually requires an article; in the united kingdom and elsewhere, the word normally is used without an article when it is the object of a preposition and when referring to a patient (\"in/to the hospital\" vs. \"in/to hospital\"); in canada, both uses are found.[citation needed]\n",
      "some patients go to a hospital just for diagnosis, treatment, or therapy and then leave (\"outpatients\") without staying overnight; while others are \"admitted\" and stay overnight or for several days or weeks or months (\"inpatients\"). hospitals usually are distinguished from other types of medical facilities by their ability to admit and care for inpatients whilst the others, which are smaller, are often described as clinics.\n",
      "the best-known type of hospital is the general hospital, also known as an acute-care hospital. these facilities handle many kinds of disease and injury, and normally have an emergency department (sometimes known as \"accident & emergency\") or trauma center to deal with immediate and urgent threats to health. larger cities may have several hospitals of varying sizes and facilities. some hospitals, especially in the united states and canada, have their own ambulance service.\n",
      "a district hospital typically is the major health care facility in its region, with large numbers of beds for intensive care, critical care, and long-term care.\n",
      "in california, \"district hospital\" refers specifically to a class of healthcare facility created shortly after world war ii to address a shortage of hospital beds in many local communities.[6][7] even today, district hospitals are the sole public hospitals in 19 of california's counties,[6] and are the sole locally-accessible hospital within 9 additional counties in which one or more other hospitals are present at substantial distance from a local community.[6] twenty-eight of california's rural hospitals and 20 of its critical-access hospitals are district hospitals.[7] they are formed by local municipalities, have boards that are individually elected by their local communities, and exist to serve local needs.[6][7] they are a particularly important provider of healthcare to uninsured patients and patients with medi-cal (which is california's medicaid program, serving low-income persons, some senior citizens, persons with disabilities, children in foster care, and pregnant women).[6][7] in 2012, district hospitals provided $54 million in uncompensated care in california.[7]\n",
      "types of specialised hospitals include rehabilitation hospitals, children's hospitals, seniors' (geriatric) hospitals, long-term acute care facilities and hospitals for dealing with specific medical needs such as psychiatric problems (see psychiatric hospital), certain disease categories such as cardiac, oncology, or orthopedic problems, and so forth. in germany specialised hospitals are called fachkrankenhaus; an example is fachkrankenhaus coswig (thoracic surgery).\n",
      "a hospital may be a single building or a number of buildings on a campus. many hospitals with pre-twentieth-century origins began as one building and evolved into campuses. some hospitals are affiliated with universities for medical research and the training of medical personnel such as physicians and nurses, often called teaching hospitals. worldwide, most hospitals are run on a nonprofit basis by governments or charities. there are however a few exceptions, e.g. china, where government funding only constitutes 10% of income of hospitals. (need citation here. chinese sources seem conflicted about the for-profit/non-profit ratio of hospitals in china)\n",
      "specialised hospitals can help reduce health care costs compared to general hospitals. for example, narayana health's bangalore cardiac unit, which is specialised in cardiac surgery, allows for significantly greater number of patients. it has 3000 beds (more than 20 times the average american hospital) and in pediatric heart surgery alone, it performs 3000 heart operations annually, making it by far the largest such facility in the world.[8][2] surgeons are paid on a fixed salary instead of per operation; thus, the costs to the hospital drops when the number of procedures increases, taking advantage of economies of scale.[8] additionally, it is argued that costs go down as all its specialists become efficient by working on one \"production line\" procedure.[2]\n",
      "a teaching hospital combines assistance to people with teaching to medical students and nurses and often is linked to a medical school, nursing school or university.\n",
      "in some countries like uk exists the clinical attachment system that is defined as a period of time when a doctor is attached to a named supervisor in a clinical unit, with the broad aims of observing clinical practice in the uk and the role of doctors and other healthcare professionals in the national health service (nhs).\n",
      "the medical facility smaller than a hospital is generally called a clinic, and often is run by a government agency for health services or a private partnership of physicians (in nations where private practise is allowed). clinics generally provide only outpatient services.\n",
      "hospitals consist of departments, traditionally called wards, especially when they have beds for inpatients, when they are sometimes also called inpatient wards. hospitals may have acute services such as an emergency department or specialist trauma centre, burn unit, surgery, or urgent care. these may then be backed up by more specialist units such as the following:\n",
      "in addition, there is the department of nursing, often headed by a chief nursing officer or director of nursing. this department is responsible for the administration of professional nursing practice, research, and policy for the hospital. nursing permeates every part of a hospital. many units or wards have both a nursing and a medical director that serve as administrators for their respective disciplines within that specialty. for example, in an intensive care nursery, the director of neonatology is responsible for the medical staff and medical care while the nursing manager/director for the intensive care nursery is responsible for all of the nurses and nursing care in that unit/ward.\n",
      "some hospitals have outpatient departments and some have chronic treatment units such as behavioral health services, dentistry, dermatology, psychiatric ward, rehabilitation services, and physical therapy.\n",
      "common support units include a dispensary or pharmacy, pathology, and radiology. hospitals also have a mortuary, where the dead are stored. on the non-medical side, there often are medical records departments, release of information departments, information management (a.k.a. im, it or is), clinical engineering (a.k.a. biomed), facilities management, plant ops (operations, also known as maintenance), dining services, and security departments.\n",
      "the earliest documented institutions aiming to provide cures were ancient egyptian temples. in ancient greece, temples dedicated to the healer-god asclepius, known as asclepieia functioned as centres of medical advice, prognosis, and healing.[9] in early india india, fa xian, a chinese buddhist monk who travelled across india c. ce 400, recorded examples of healing institutions.[10] according to the mahavamsa, the ancient chronicle of sinhalese royalty, written in the sixth century ce, king pandukabhaya of sri lanka (r. 437–367 bce) had lying-in-homes and hospitals (sivikasotthi-sala).[11] a hospital and medical training centre also existed at gundeshapur, a major city in southwest of the sassanid persian empire founded in ce 271 by shapur i.[12]\n",
      "the declaration of christianity as an accepted religion in the roman empire drove an expansion of the provision of care. following the first council of nicaea in ce 325 construction of a hospital in every cathedral town was begun, including among the earliest hospitals by saint sampson in constantinople and by basil, bishop of caesarea in modern-day turkey.[13] by the twelfth century, constantinople had two well-organised hospitals, staffed by doctors who were both male and female. facilities included systematic treatment procedures and specialised wards for various diseases.[14]\n",
      "the earliest general hospital was built in 805 in baghdad by harun al-rashid.[15][16] by the tenth century, baghdad had five more hospitals, while damascus had six hospitals by the 15th century and córdoba alone had 50 major hospitals, many exclusively for the military.[17] compared to contemporaneous christian institutions, which were poor and sick relief facilities offered by some monasteries, the islamic hospital was a more elaborate institution with a wider range of functions. in islam, there was a moral imperative to treat the ill regardless of financial status. islamic hospitals tended to be large, urban structures, and were largely secular institutions, many open to all, whether male or female, civilian or military, child or adult, rich or poor, muslim or non-muslim. the islamic hospital served several purposes, as a center of medical treatment, a home for patients recovering from illness or accidents, an insane asylum, and a retirement home with basic maintenance needs for the aged and infirm.[18]\n",
      "hospitals in this era were the first to require medical diplomas to license doctors, and compensation for negligence could be made.[19]\n",
      "hospitals were forbidden by law to turn away patients who were unable to pay.[20] eventually, charitable foundations called waqfs were formed to support hospitals, as well as schools.[20] part of the state budget also went towards maintaining hospitals.[17]\n",
      "in europe the medieval concept of christian care evolved during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries into a secular one. in england, after the dissolution of the monasteries in 1540 by king henry viii, the church abruptly ceased to be the supporter of hospitals, and only by direct petition from the citizens of london, were the hospitals st bartholomew's, st thomas's and st mary of bethlehem's (bedlam) endowed directly by the crown; this was the first instance of secular support being provided for medical institutions.\n",
      "the voluntary hospital movement began in the early 18th century, with hospitals being founded in london by the 1720s, including westminster hospital (1719) promoted by the private bank c. hoare & co and guy's hospital (1724) funded from the bequest of the wealthy merchant, thomas guy.\n",
      "other hospitals sprang up in london and other british cities over the century, many paid for by private subscriptions.  st bartholomew's opened in london in 1730, and the london hospital in 1752.\n",
      "these hospitals represented a turning point in the function of the institution; they began to evolve from being basic places of care for the sick to becoming centres of medical innovation and discovery and the principal place for the education and training of prospective practitioners. some of the era's greatest surgeons and doctors worked and passed on their knowledge at the hospitals.[21] they also changed from being mere homes of refuge to being complex institutions for the provision of medicine and care for sick. the charité was founded in berlin in 1710 by king frederick i of prussia as a response to an outbreak of plague.\n",
      "the concept of voluntary hospitals also spread to colonial america; the bellevue hospital center opened in 1736; the pennsylvania hospital opened in 1752, new york hospital in 1771, and massachusetts general hospital in 1811.  when the vienna general hospital opened in 1784 (instantly becoming the world's largest hospital), physicians acquired a new facility that gradually developed into one of the most important research centres.[22]\n",
      "another enlightenment era charitable innovation was the dispensary; these would issue the poor with medicines free of charge. the london dispensary opened its doors in 1696 as the first such clinic in the british empire. the idea was slow to catch on until the 1770s, when many such organisations began to appear, including the public dispensary of edinburgh (1776), the metropolitan dispensary and charitable fund (1779) and the finsbury dispensary (1780). dispensaries were also opened in new york 1771, philadelphia 1786, and boston 1796.[23]\n",
      "the royal naval hospital, stonehouse, plymouth, was a pioneer of hospital design in having \"pavilions\" to minimize the spread of infection. john wesley visited in 1785, and commented \"i never saw anything of the kind so complete; every part is so convenient, and so admirably neat. but there is nothing superfluous, and nothing purely ornamented, either within or without.\" this revolutionary design was made more widely known by john howard, the philanthropist. in 1787 the french government sent two scholar administrators, coulomb and tenon, who had visited most of the hospitals in europe.[24] they were impressed and the \"pavilion\" design was copied in france and throughout europe.\n",
      "english physician thomas percival (1740–1804) wrote a comprehensive system of medical conduct, medical ethics; or, a code of institutes and precepts, adapted to the professional conduct of physicians and surgeons (1803) that set the standard for many textbooks.[25] in the mid-19th century, hospitals and the medical profession became more professionalised, with a reorganisation of hospital management along more bureaucratic and administrative lines. the apothecaries act 1815 made it compulsory for medical students to practise for at least half a year at a hospital as part of their training.[26]\n",
      "florence nightingale pioneered the modern profession of nursing during the crimean war when she set an example of compassion, commitment to patient care and diligent and thoughtful hospital administration. the first official nurses' training programme, the nightingale school for nurses, was opened in 1860, with the mission of training nurses to work in hospitals, to work with the poor and to teach.[27] nightingale was instrumental in reforming the nature of the hospital, by improving sanitation standards and changing the image of the hospital from a place the sick would go to die, to an institution devoted to recuperation and healing. she also emphasised the importance of statistical measurement for determining the success rate of a given intervention and pushed for administrative reform at hospitals.[28]\n",
      "by the late 19th century, the modern hospital was beginning to take shape with a proliferation of a variety of public and private hospital systems. by the 1870s, hospitals had more than trebled their original average intake of 3,000 patients. in continental europe the new hospitals generally were built and run from public funds. the national health service, the principal provider of health care in the united kingdom, was founded in 1948. during the nineteenth century, the second viennese medical school emerged with the contributions of physicians such as carl freiherr von rokitansky, josef škoda, ferdinand ritter von hebra, and ignaz philipp semmelweis. basic medical science expanded and specialisation advanced. furthermore, the first dermatology, eye, as well as ear, nose, and throat clinics in the world were founded in vienna, being considered as the birth of specialised medicine.[29]\n",
      "by the late 19th and the beginning 20th century, medical advancements such as anesthesia and sterile techniques that could make surgery less risky, and availability of more advanced diagnostic devices such as x-rays continued to make hospitals a more attractive option for treatment. the number of hospitalizations in the united states continued to grow and reached its peak in 1981 with 171 admissions per 1000 americans and 6933 hospitals.[30]\n",
      "this trend, however, has been reversed since then, with the rate of hospitalization falling by more than 10% and the number of us hospitals shrinking from 6933 in 1981 to 5534 in 2016.[31] among the reasons for this are the increasing availability of more complex care elsewhere such as at home or at the physicians' offices and also the less therapeutic and more life-threatening image of the hospitals in the eyes of the public.[32][30]\n",
      "microhospitals, which range from eight beds to fifty, are expanding in the united states.[33]\n",
      "modern hospitals measure various efficiency metrics such as occupancy rates, average length of stay, time to service, patient satisfaction, physician performance, patient readmission rate, inpatient mortality rate, and case mix index.[34]\n",
      "modern hospitals are in part defined by their ability to admit patients into inpatient care, which affects reimbursement. in the us, a patient may sleep in a hospital bed, but considered outpatient and \"under observation\" if not formally admitted.[35] in the us, inpatient stays are covered under medicare part a, but a hospital might keep a patient under observation which is only covered under medicare part b, and subjects the patient to additional coinsurance costs.[35]\n",
      "in the united states, occupancy rates dropped from 77% in 1980 to 60% in 2013.[36] us hospital-based healthcare systems reported poor financial results in 2016 and 2017 as they adapted to healthcare reform and continued decline in admissions.[37] hospitals were also affected by the center for medicare and medicaid services (cms) rules, including in 2013 included a controversial \"two-midnight\" rule for inpatient admissions.[38] the rule was intended to reduce long-term \"observation\" stays, which increased from 3% to 8% of all cases between 2006 and 2011.[35]\n",
      "modern hospitals are either funded by the government of the country in which they are situated, or survive financially by competing in the private sector (a number of hospitals also are still supported by the historical type of charitable or religious associations).\n",
      "in the united kingdom for example, a relatively comprehensive, \"free at the point of delivery\" health care system exists, funded by the state. hospital care is thus relatively easily available to all legal residents, although free emergency care is available to anyone, regardless of nationality or status. as hospitals prioritise their limited resources, there is a tendency for 'waiting lists' for non-crucial treatment in countries with such systems, as opposed to letting higher-payers get treated first, so sometimes those who can afford it take out private health care to get treatment more quickly.[39]\n",
      "in some countries such as the usa, hospitals typically operate privately and in some cases on a for-profit basis; for example, the multinational corporation hospital corporation of america operates hospitals across the country.[40] the list of procedures and their prices is called a chargemaster; however, these prices don't reflect the typical cost of the procedure, which is typically lower due to in-network negotiation.[41]\n",
      "where for-profit hospitals in such countries admit uninsured patients in emergency situations (such as during and after hurricane katrina in the usa), they incur direct financial losses,[40] ensuring that there is a clear disincentive to admit such patients. in the united states, laws exist to ensure patients receive care in life-threatening emergency situations regardless of the patient's ability to pay.[42]\n",
      "as the quality of health care has increasingly become an issue around the world, hospitals have increasingly had to pay serious attention to this matter. independent external assessment of quality is one of the most powerful ways to assess this aspect of health care, and hospital accreditation is one means by which this is achieved. in many parts of the world such accreditation is sourced from other countries, a phenomenon known as international healthcare accreditation, by groups such as accreditation canada from canada, the joint commission from the usa, the trent accreditation scheme from great britain, and haute authorité de santé (has) from france.\n",
      "the world health organization noted in 2011 that going into hospital was far riskier than flying.  globally the chance of a patient being subject to an error was about 10%  and the chance of death resulting from an error wass about 1 in 300 according to liam donaldson. 7% of hospitalised patients in developed countries, and 10% in developing countries, acquire at least one health care-associated infection. in the usa 1.7 million infections are acquired in hospital each year, leading to 100,000 deaths, figures much worse than in europe where there were 4.5 million infections and 37,000 deaths.[43]\n",
      "modern hospital buildings are designed to minimise the effort of medical personnel and the possibility of contamination while maximising the efficiency of the whole system. travel time for personnel within the hospital and the transportation of patients between units is facilitated and minimised. the building also should be built to accommodate heavy departments such as radiology and operating rooms while space for special wiring, plumbing, and waste disposal must be allowed for in the design.[44]\n",
      "however, many hospitals, even those considered \"modern\", are the product of continual and often badly managed growth over decades or even centuries, with utilitarian new sections added on as needs and finances dictate. as a result, dutch architectural historian cor wagenaar has called many hospitals:\n",
      "some newer hospitals now try to re-establish design that takes the patient's psychological needs into account, such as providing more fresh air, better views and more pleasant colour schemes. these ideas harken back to the late eighteenth century, when the concept of providing fresh air and access to the 'healing powers of nature' were first employed by hospital architects in improving their buildings.[45]\n",
      "the research of british medical association is showing that good hospital design can reduce patient's recovery time. exposure to daylight is effective in reducing depression. single-sex accommodation help ensure that patients are treated in privacy and with dignity. exposure to nature and hospital gardens is also important – looking out windows improves patients' moods and reduces blood pressure and stress level. open windows in patient rooms have also demonstrated some evidence of beneficial outcomes by improving airflow and increased microbial diversity.[46][47] eliminating long corridors can reduce nurses' fatigue and stress.[48]\n",
      "another ongoing major development is the change from a ward-based system (where patients are accommodated in communal rooms, separated by movable partitions) to one in which they are accommodated in individual rooms. the ward-based system has been described as very efficient, especially for the medical staff, but is considered to be more stressful for patients and detrimental to their privacy. a major constraint on providing all patients with their own rooms is however found in the higher cost of building and operating such a hospital; this causes some hospitals to charge for private rooms.[49]\n",

      "learning management systems were designed to identify training and learning gaps, utilizing analytical data and reporting. lmss are focused on online learning delivery but support a range of uses, acting as a platform for online content, including courses, both asynchronous based and synchronous based.  an lms may offer classroom management for instructor-led training or a flipped classroom, used in higher education, but not in the corporate space.\n",

      "case-based reasoning (cbr), broadly construed, is the process of solving new problems based on the solutions of similar past problems. an auto mechanic who fixes an engine by recalling another car that exhibited similar symptoms is using case-based reasoning.  a lawyer who advocates a particular outcome in a trial based on legal precedents or a judge who creates case law is using case-based reasoning.  so, too, an engineer copying working elements of nature (practicing biomimicry), is treating nature as a database of solutions to problems. case-based reasoning is a prominent type of analogy solution making.\n",
      "it has been argued that case-based reasoning is not only a powerful method for computer reasoning, but also a pervasive behavior in everyday human problem solving;  or, more radically, that all reasoning is based on past cases personally experienced. this view is related to prototype theory, which is most deeply explored in cognitive science.\n",

      "artificial neural networks (ann) or connectionist systems are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains.[1][2] the neural network itself is not an algorithm, but rather a framework for many different machine learning algorithms to work together and process complex data inputs.[3] such systems \"learn\" to perform tasks by considering examples, generally without being programmed with any task-specific rules. for example, in image recognition, they might learn to identify images that contain cats by analyzing example images that have been manually labeled as \"cat\" or \"no cat\" and using the results to identify cats in other images. they do this without any prior knowledge about cats, for example, that they have fur, tails, whiskers and cat-like faces. instead, they automatically generate identifying characteristics from the learning material that they process.\n",
      "an ann is based on a collection of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. each connection, like the synapses in a biological brain, can transmit a signal from one artificial neuron to another. an artificial neuron that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional artificial neurons connected to it.\n",
      "in common ann implementations, the signal at a connection between artificial neurons is a real number, and the output of each artificial neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs. the connections between artificial neurons are called 'edges'. artificial neurons and edges typically have a weight that adjusts as learning proceeds. the weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection. artificial neurons may have a threshold such that the signal is only sent if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold. typically, artificial neurons are aggregated into layers. different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs. signals travel from the first layer (the input layer), to the last layer (the output layer), possibly after traversing the layers multiple times.\n",
      "the original goal of the ann approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would. however, over time, attention moved to performing specific tasks, leading to deviations from biology. artificial neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks, including computer vision, speech recognition, machine translation, social network filtering, playing board and video games and medical diagnosis.\n",
      "warren mcculloch and walter pitts[4] (1943) created a computational model for neural networks based on mathematics and algorithms called threshold logic. this model paved the way for neural network research to split into two approaches. one approach focused on biological processes in the brain while the other focused on the application of neural networks to artificial intelligence. this work led to work on nerve networks and their link to finite automata.[5]\n",
      "in the late 1940s, d. o. hebb[6] created a learning hypothesis based on the mechanism of neural plasticity that became known as hebbian learning. hebbian learning is unsupervised learning. this evolved into models for long term potentiation. researchers started applying these ideas to computational models in 1948 with turing's b-type machines. farley and clark[7] (1954) first used computational machines, then called \"calculators\", to simulate a hebbian network. other neural network computational machines were created by rochester, holland, habit and duda (1956).[8] rosenblatt[9] (1958) created the perceptron, an algorithm for pattern recognition. with mathematical notation, rosenblatt described circuitry not in the basic perceptron, such as the exclusive-or circuit that could not be processed by neural networks at the time.[10] in 1959, a biological model proposed by nobel laureates hubel and wiesel was based on their discovery of two types of cells in the primary visual cortex: simple cells and complex cells.[11] the first functional networks with many layers were published by ivakhnenko and lapa in 1965, becoming the group method of data handling.[12][13][14]\n",
      "neural network research stagnated after machine learning research by minsky and papert (1969),[15] who discovered two key issues with the computational machines that processed neural networks. the first was that basic perceptrons were incapable of processing the exclusive-or circuit. the second was that computers didn't have enough processing power to effectively handle the work required by large neural networks. neural network research slowed until computers achieved far greater processing power. much of artificial intelligence had focused on high-level (symbolic) models that are processed by using algorithms, characterized for example by expert systems with knowledge embodied in if-then rules, until in the late 1980s research expanded to low-level (sub-symbolic) machine learning, characterized by knowledge embodied in the parameters of a cognitive model.[citation needed]\n",
      "a key trigger for renewed interest in neural networks and learning was werbos's (1975) backpropagation algorithm that effectively solved the exclusive-or problem by making the training of multi-layer networks feasible and efficient. backpropagation distributed the error term back up through the layers, by modifying the weights at each node.[10]\n",
      "in the mid-1980s, parallel distributed processing became popular under the name connectionism. rumelhart and mcclelland (1986) described the use of connectionism to simulate neural processes.[16]\n",
      "support vector machines and other, much simpler methods such as linear classifiers gradually overtook neural networks in machine learning popularity. however, using neural networks transformed some domains, such as the prediction of protein structures.[17][18]\n",
      "in 1992, max-pooling was introduced to help with least shift invariance and tolerance to deformation to aid in 3d object recognition.[19][20][21]\n",
      "in 2010, backpropagation training through max-pooling was accelerated by gpus and shown to perform better than other pooling variants.[22]\n",
      "the vanishing gradient problem affects many-layered feedforward networks that used backpropagation and also recurrent neural networks (rnns).[23][24] as errors propagate from layer to layer, they shrink exponentially with the number of layers, impeding the tuning of neuron weights that is based on those errors, particularly affecting deep networks.\n",
      "to overcome this problem, schmidhuber adopted a multi-level hierarchy of networks (1992) pre-trained one level at a time by unsupervised learning and fine-tuned by backpropagation.[25] behnke (2003) relied only on the sign of the gradient (rprop)[26] on problems such as image reconstruction and face localization.\n",
      "hinton et al. (2006) proposed learning a high-level representation using successive layers of binary or real-valued latent variables with a restricted boltzmann machine[27] to model each layer. once sufficiently many layers have been learned, the deep architecture may be used as a generative model by reproducing the data when sampling down the model (an \"ancestral pass\") from the top level feature activations.[28][29] in 2012, ng and dean created a network that learned to recognize higher-level concepts, such as cats, only from watching unlabeled images taken from youtube videos.[30]\n",
      "earlier challenges in training deep neural networks were successfully addressed with methods such as unsupervised pre-training, while available computing power increased through the use of gpus and distributed computing. neural networks were deployed on a large scale, particularly in image and visual recognition problems. this became known as \"deep learning\".[citation needed]\n",
      "computational devices were created in cmos, for both biophysical simulation and neuromorphic computing. nanodevices[31] for very large scale principal components analyses and convolution may create a new class of neural computing because they are fundamentally analog rather than digital (even though the first implementations may use digital devices).[32] ciresan and colleagues (2010)[33] in schmidhuber's group showed that despite the vanishing gradient problem, gpus make back-propagation feasible for many-layered feedforward neural networks.\n",
      "between 2009 and 2012, recurrent neural networks and deep feedforward neural networks developed in schmidhuber's research group won eight international competitions in pattern recognition and machine learning.[34][35] for example, the bi-directional and multi-dimensional long short-term memory (lstm)[36][37][38][39] of graves et al. won three competitions in connected handwriting recognition at the 2009 international conference on document analysis and recognition (icdar), without any prior knowledge about the three languages to be learned.[38][37]\n",
      "ciresan and colleagues won pattern recognition contests, including the ijcnn 2011 traffic sign recognition competition,[40] the isbi 2012 segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopy stacks challenge[41] and others. their neural networks were the first pattern recognizers to achieve human-competitive or even superhuman performance[42] on benchmarks such as traffic sign recognition (ijcnn 2012), or the mnist handwritten digits problem.\n",
      "researchers demonstrated (2010) that deep neural networks interfaced to a hidden markov model with context-dependent states that define the neural network output layer can drastically reduce errors in large-vocabulary speech recognition tasks such as voice search.\n",
      "gpu-based implementations[43] of this approach won many pattern recognition contests, including the ijcnn 2011 traffic sign recognition competition,[40] the isbi 2012 segmentation of neuronal structures in em stacks challenge,[41] the imagenet competition[44] and others.\n",
      "deep, highly nonlinear neural architectures similar to the neocognitron[45] and the \"standard architecture of vision\",[46] inspired by simple and complex cells, were pre-trained by unsupervised methods by hinton.[47][28] a team from his lab won a 2012 contest sponsored by merck to design software to help find molecules that might identify new drugs.[48]\n",
      "as of 2011[update], the state of the art in deep learning feedforward networks alternated between convolutional layers and max-pooling layers,[43][49] topped by several fully or sparsely connected layers followed by a final classification layer. learning is usually done without unsupervised pre-training. in the convolutional layer, there are filters that are convolved with the input. each filter is equivalent to a weights vector that has to be trained.\n",
      "such supervised deep learning methods were the first to achieve human-competitive performance on certain tasks.[42]\n",
      "artificial neural networks were able to guarantee shift invariance to deal with small and large natural objects in large cluttered scenes, only when invariance extended beyond shift, to all ann-learned concepts, such as location, type (object class label), scale, lighting and others. this was realized in developmental networks (dns)[50] whose embodiments are where-what networks, wwn-1 (2008)[51] through wwn-7 (2013).[52]\n",

      "the network forms by connecting the output of certain neurons to the input of other neurons forming a directed, weighted graph. the weights as well as the functions that compute the activation can be modified by a process called learning which is governed by a learning rule.[53]\n",

      "with inertia, the problems of getting stuck (in steep ravines and flat plateaus) are avoided. since, for example, the gradient of the error function becomes very small in flat plateaus, a plateau would immediately lead to a \"deceleration\" of the gradient descent. this deceleration is delayed by the addition of the inertia term so that a flat plateau can be escaped more quickly.\n",
      "two modes of learning are available: stochastic and batch. in stochastic learning, each input creates a weight adjustment. in batch learning weights are adjusted based on a batch of inputs, accumulating errors over the batch. stochastic learning introduces \"noise\" into the gradient descent process, using the local gradient calculated from one data point; this reduces the chance of the network getting stuck in local minima. however, batch learning typically yields a faster, more stable descent to a local minimum, since each update is performed in the direction of the average error of the batch. a common compromise choice is to use \"mini-batches\", meaning small batches and with samples in each batch selected stochastically from the entire data set.\n",
      "the group method of data handling (gmdh)[97] features fully automatic structural and parametric model optimization. the node activation functions are kolmogorov-gabor polynomials that permit additions and multiplications. it used a deep feedforward multilayer perceptron with eight layers.[98] it is a supervised learning network that grows layer by layer, where each layer is trained by regression analysis. useless items are detected using a validation set, and pruned through regularization. the size and depth of the resulting network depends on the task.[99]\n",
      "a convolutional neural network (cnn) is a class of deep, feed-forward networks, composed of one or more convolutional layers with fully connected layers (matching those in typical artificial neural networks) on top. it uses tied weights and pooling layers. in particular, max-pooling[20] is often structured via fukushima's convolutional architecture.[100] this architecture allows cnns to take advantage of the 2d structure of input data.\n",
      "cnns are suitable for processing visual and other two-dimensional data.[101][102] they have shown superior results in both image and speech applications. they can be trained with standard backpropagation. cnns are easier to train than other regular, deep, feed-forward neural networks and have many fewer parameters to estimate.[103] examples of applications in computer vision include deepdream[104] and robot navigation.[105]\n",
      "a recent development has been that of capsule neural network (capsnet), the idea behind which is to add structures called capsules to a cnn and to reuse output from several of those capsules to form more stable (with respect to various perturbations) representations for higher order capsules.[106]\n",
      "long short-term memory (lstm) networks are rnns that avoid the vanishing gradient problem.[107] lstm is normally augmented by recurrent gates called forget gates.[108] lstm networks prevent backpropagated errors from vanishing or exploding.[23] instead errors can flow backwards through unlimited numbers of virtual layers in space-unfolded lstm. that is, lstm can learn \"very deep learning\" tasks[12] that require memories of events that happened thousands or even millions of discrete time steps ago. problem-specific lstm-like topologies can be evolved.[109] lstm can handle long delays and signals that have a mix of low and high frequency components.\n",
      "stacks of lstm rnns[110] trained by connectionist temporal classification (ctc)[111] can find an rnn weight matrix that maximizes the probability of the label sequences in a training set, given the corresponding input sequences. ctc achieves both alignment and recognition.\n",
      "in 2003, lstm started to become competitive with traditional speech recognizers.[112] in 2007, the combination with ctc achieved first good results on speech data.[113] in 2009, a ctc-trained lstm was the first rnn to win pattern recognition contests, when it won several competitions in connected handwriting recognition.[12][38] in 2014, baidu used ctc-trained rnns to break the switchboard hub5'00 speech recognition benchmark, without traditional speech processing methods.[114] lstm also improved large-vocabulary speech recognition,[115][116] text-to-speech synthesis,[117] for google android,[57][118] and photo-real talking heads.[119] in 2015, google's speech recognition experienced a 49% improvement through ctc-trained lstm.[120]\n",
      "lstm became popular in natural language processing. unlike previous models based on hmms and similar concepts, lstm can learn to recognise context-sensitive languages.[121] lstm improved machine translation,[122][123] language modeling[124] and multilingual language processing.[125] lstm combined with cnns improved automatic image captioning.[126]\n",
      "deep reservoir computing and deep echo state networks (deepesns)[127][128] provide a framework for efficiently trained models for hierarchical processing of temporal data, while enabling the investigation of the inherent role of rnn layered composition.[clarification needed]\n",
      "a deep belief network (dbn) is a probabilistic, generative model made up of multiple layers of hidden units. it can be considered a composition of simple learning modules that make up each layer.[129]\n",
      "a dbn can be used to generatively pre-train a dnn by using the learned dbn weights as the initial dnn weights. backpropagation or other discriminative algorithms can then tune these weights. this is particularly helpful when training data are limited, because poorly initialized weights can significantly hinder model performance. these pre-trained weights are in a region of the weight space that is closer to the optimal weights than were they randomly chosen. this allows for both improved modeling and faster convergence of the fine-tuning phase.[130]\n",
      "large memory storage and retrieval neural networks (lamstar)[131][132] are fast deep learning neural networks of many layers that can use many filters simultaneously. these filters may be nonlinear, stochastic, logic, non-stationary, or even non-analytical. they are biologically motivated and learn continuously.\n",
      "a lamstar neural network may serve as a dynamic neural network in spatial or time domains or both. its speed is provided by hebbian link-weights[133] that integrate the various and usually different filters (preprocessing functions) into its many layers and to dynamically rank the significance of the various layers and functions relative to a given learning task. this grossly imitates biological learning which integrates various preprocessors (cochlea, retina, etc.) and cortexes (auditory, visual, etc.) and their various regions. its deep learning capability is further enhanced by using inhibition, correlation and its ability to cope with incomplete data, or \"lost\" neurons or layers even amidst a task. it is fully transparent due to its link weights. the link-weights allow dynamic determination of innovation and redundancy, and facilitate the ranking of layers, of filters or of individual neurons relative to a task.\n",
      "lamstar has been applied to many domains, including medical[134][135][136] and financial predictions,[137] adaptive filtering of noisy speech in unknown noise,[138] still-image recognition,[139] video image recognition,[140] software security[141] and adaptive control of non-linear systems.[142] lamstar had a much faster learning speed and somewhat lower error rate than a cnn based on relu-function filters and max pooling, in 20 comparative studies.[143]\n",
      "these applications demonstrate delving into aspects of the data that are hidden from shallow learning networks and the human senses, such as in the cases of predicting onset of sleep apnea events,[135] of an electrocardiogram of a fetus as recorded from skin-surface electrodes placed on the mother's abdomen early in pregnancy,[136] of financial prediction[131] or in blind filtering of noisy speech.[138]\n",
      "lamstar was proposed in 1996 (a u.s. patent 5,920,852 a) and was further developed graupe and kordylewski from 1997–2002.[144][145][146] a modified version, known as lamstar 2, was developed by schneider and graupe in 2008.[147][148]\n",

      "deep neural networks can be potentially improved by deepening and parameter reduction, while maintaining trainability. while training extremely deep (e.g., 1 million layers) neural networks might not be practical, cpu-like architectures such as pointer networks[199] and neural random-access machines[200] overcome this limitation by using external random-access memory and other components that typically belong to a computer architecture such as registers, alu and pointers. such systems operate on probability distribution vectors stored in memory cells and registers. thus, the model is fully differentiable and trains end-to-end. the key characteristic of these models is that their depth, the size of their short-term memory, and the number of parameters can be altered independently – unlike models like lstm, whose number of parameters grows quadratically with memory size.\n",
      "encoder–decoder frameworks are based on neural networks that map highly structured input to highly structured output. the approach arose in the context of machine translation,[201][202][203] where the input and output are written sentences in two natural languages. in that work, an lstm rnn or cnn was used as an encoder to summarize a source sentence, and the summary was decoded using a conditional rnn language model to produce the translation.[204] these systems share building blocks: gated rnns and cnns and trained attention mechanisms.\n",

      "because of their ability to reproduce and model nonlinear processes, artificial neural networks have found many applications in a wide range of disciplines.\n",
      "application areas include system identification and control (vehicle control, trajectory prediction,[209] process control, natural resource management), quantum chemistry,[210] general game playing,[211] pattern recognition (radar systems, face identification, signal classification,[212] 3d reconstruction,[213] object recognition and more), sequence recognition (gesture, speech, handwritten and printed text recognition), medical diagnosis, finance[214] (e.g. automated trading systems), data mining, visualization, machine translation, social network filtering[215] and e-mail spam filtering.\n",
      "artificial neural networks have been used to diagnose cancers, including lung cancer,[216] prostate cancer, colorectal cancer[217] and to distinguish highly invasive cancer cell lines from less invasive lines using only cell shape information.[218][219]\n",
      "artificial neural networks have been used to accelerate reliability analysis of infrastructures subject to natural disasters[220][221] and to predict foundation settlements.[222]\n",
      "artificial neural networks have also been used for building black-box models in geoscience: hydrology,[223][224] ocean modelling and coastal engineering,[225][226] and geomorphology.[227]\n",
      "artificial neural networks have been employed with some success also in cybersecurity, with the objective to discriminate between legitimate activities and malicious ones. for example, machine learning has been used for classifying android malware,[228] for identifying domains belonging to threat actors[229] and for detecting urls posing a security risk.[230] research is being carried out also on ann systems designed for penetration testing,[231] for detecting botnets,[232] credit cards frauds,[233] network intrusions and, more in general, potentially infected machines.\n",
      "many types of models are used, defined at different levels of abstraction and modeling different aspects of neural systems. they range from models of the short-term behavior of individual neurons,[234] models of how the dynamics of neural circuitry arise from interactions between individual neurons and finally to models of how behavior can arise from abstract neural modules that represent complete subsystems. these include models of the long-term, and short-term plasticity, of neural systems and their relations to learning and memory from the individual neuron to the system level.\n",
      "the multilayer perceptron is a universal function approximator, as proven by the universal approximation theorem. however, the proof is not constructive regarding the number of neurons required, the network topology, the weights and the learning parameters.\n",
      "a specific recurrent architecture with rational valued weights (as opposed to full precision real number-valued weights) has the full power of a universal turing machine,[235] using a finite number of neurons and standard linear connections. further, the use of irrational values for weights results in a machine with super-turing power.[236]\n",
      "models' \"capacity\" property roughly corresponds to their ability to model any given function. it is related to the amount of information that can be stored in the network and to the notion of complexity.[citation needed]\n",
      "models may not consistently converge on a single solution, firstly because many local minima may exist, depending on the cost function and the model. secondly, the optimization method used might not guarantee to converge when it begins far from any local minimum. thirdly, for sufficiently large data or parameters, some methods become impractical. however, for cmac neural network, a recursive least squares algorithm was introduced to train it, and this algorithm can be guaranteed to converge in one step.[93]\n",
      "applications whose goal is to create a system that generalizes well to unseen examples, face the possibility of over-training. this arises in convoluted or over-specified systems when the capacity of the network significantly exceeds the needed free parameters. two approaches address over-training. the first is to use cross-validation and similar techniques to check for the presence of over-training and optimally select hyperparameters to minimize the generalization error. the second is to use some form of regularization. this concept emerges in a probabilistic (bayesian) framework, where regularization can be performed by selecting a larger prior probability over simpler models; but also in statistical learning theory, where the goal is to minimize over two quantities: the 'empirical risk' and the 'structural risk', which roughly corresponds to the error over the training set and the predicted error in unseen data due to overfitting.\n",
      "supervised neural networks that use a mean squared error (mse) cost function can use formal statistical methods to determine the confidence of the trained model. the mse on a validation set can be used as an estimate for variance. this value can then be used to calculate the confidence interval of the output of the network, assuming a normal distribution. a confidence analysis made this way is statistically valid as long as the output probability distribution stays the same and the network is not modified.\n",
      "by assigning a softmax activation function, a generalization of the logistic function, on the output layer of the neural network (or a softmax component in a component-based neural network) for categorical target variables, the outputs can be interpreted as posterior probabilities. this is very useful in classification as it gives a certainty measure on classifications.\n",
      "the softmax activation function is:\n",
      "\n",
      "a common criticism of neural networks, particularly in robotics, is that they require too much training for real-world operation.[citation needed] potential solutions include randomly shuffling training examples, by using a numerical optimization algorithm that does not take too large steps when changing the network connections following an example and by grouping examples in so-called mini-batches. improving the training efficiency and convergence capability has always been an ongoing research area for neural network. for example, by introducing a recursive least squares algorithm for cmac neural network, the training process only takes one step to converge.[93]\n",
      "a fundamental objection is that they do not reflect how real neurons function. back propagation is a critical part of most artificial neural networks, although no such mechanism exists in biological neural networks.[237] how information is coded by real neurons is not known. sensor neurons fire action potentials more frequently with sensor activation and muscle cells pull more strongly when their associated motor neurons receive action potentials more frequently.[238] other than the case of relaying information from a sensor neuron to a motor neuron, almost nothing of the principles of how information is handled by biological neural networks is known. this is a subject of active research in neural coding.\n",
      "the motivation behind artificial neural networks is not necessarily to strictly replicate neural function, but to use biological neural networks as an inspiration. a central claim of artificial neural networks is therefore that it embodies some new and powerful general principle for processing information. unfortunately, these general principles are ill-defined. it is often claimed that they are emergent from the network itself. this allows simple statistical association (the basic function of artificial neural networks) to be described as learning or recognition. alexander dewdney commented that, as a result, artificial neural networks have a \"something-for-nothing quality, one that imparts a peculiar aura of laziness and a distinct lack of curiosity about just how good these computing systems are. no human hand (or mind) intervenes; solutions are found as if by magic; and no one, it seems, has learned anything\".[239]\n",
      "biological brains use both shallow and deep circuits as reported by brain anatomy,[240] displaying a wide variety of invariance. weng[241] argued that the brain self-wires largely according to signal statistics and therefore, a serial cascade cannot catch all major statistical dependencies.\n",
      "large and effective neural networks require considerable computing resources.[242] while the brain has hardware tailored to the task of processing signals through a graph of neurons, simulating even a simplified neuron on von neumann architecture may compel a neural network designer to fill many millions of database rows for its connections –  which can consume vast amounts of memory and storage. furthermore, the designer often needs to transmit signals through many of these connections and their associated neurons –  which must often be matched with enormous cpu processing power and time.\n",
      "schmidhuber notes that the resurgence of neural networks in the twenty-first century is largely attributable to advances in hardware: from 1991 to 2015, computing power, especially as delivered by gpgpus (on gpus), has increased around a million-fold, making the standard backpropagation algorithm feasible for training networks that are several layers deeper than before.[243] the use of accelerators such as fpgas and gpus can reduce training times from months to days.[244][242]\n",
      "neuromorphic engineering addresses the hardware difficulty directly, by constructing non-von-neumann chips to directly implement neural networks in circuitry. another chip optimized for neural network processing is called a tensor processing unit, or tpu.[245]\n",
      "arguments against dewdney's position are that neural networks have been successfully used to solve many complex and diverse tasks, ranging from autonomously flying aircraft[246] to detecting credit card fraud to mastering the game of go.\n",
      "technology writer roger bridgman commented:\n",
      "although it is true that analyzing what has been learned by an artificial neural network is difficult, it is much easier to do so than to analyze what has been learned by a biological neural network. furthermore, researchers involved in exploring learning algorithms for neural networks are gradually uncovering general principles that allow a learning machine to be successful. for example, local vs non-local learning and shallow vs deep architecture.[248]\n",
      "advocates of hybrid models (combining neural networks and symbolic approaches), claim that such a mixture can better capture the mechanisms of the human mind.[249][250]\n",
      "artificial neural networks have many variations. the simplest, static types have one or more static components, including number of units, number of layers, unit weights and topology. dynamic types allow one or more of these to change during the learning process. the latter are much more complicated, but can shorten learning periods and produce better results. some types allow/require learning to be \"supervised\" by the operator, while others operate independently. some types operate purely in hardware, while others are purely software and run on general purpose computers.\n",

      "data mining is a particular data analysis technique that focuses on modeling and knowledge discovery for predictive rather than purely descriptive purposes, while business intelligence covers data analysis that relies heavily on aggregation, focusing mainly on business information.[2] in statistical applications, data analysis can be divided into descriptive statistics, exploratory data analysis (eda), and confirmatory data analysis (cda). eda focuses on discovering new features in the data while cda focuses on confirming or falsifying existing hypotheses. predictive analytics focuses on application of statistical models for predictive forecasting or classification, while text analytics applies statistical, linguistic, and structural techniques to extract and classify information from textual sources, a species of unstructured data. all of the above are varieties of data analysis.\n",
      "data integration is a precursor to data analysis,[according to whom?] and data analysis is closely linked[how?] to data visualization and data dissemination. the term data analysis is sometimes used as a synonym for data modeling.\n",

      "artificial neural networks (ann) or connectionist systems are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains.[1][2] the neural network itself is not an algorithm, but rather a framework for many different machine learning algorithms to work together and process complex data inputs.[3] such systems \"learn\" to perform tasks by considering examples, generally without being programmed with any task-specific rules. for example, in image recognition, they might learn to identify images that contain cats by analyzing example images that have been manually labeled as \"cat\" or \"no cat\" and using the results to identify cats in other images. they do this without any prior knowledge about cats, for example, that they have fur, tails, whiskers and cat-like faces. instead, they automatically generate identifying characteristics from the learning material that they process.\n",
      "an ann is based on a collection of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. each connection, like the synapses in a biological brain, can transmit a signal from one artificial neuron to another. an artificial neuron that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional artificial neurons connected to it.\n",
      "in common ann implementations, the signal at a connection between artificial neurons is a real number, and the output of each artificial neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs. the connections between artificial neurons are called 'edges'. artificial neurons and edges typically have a weight that adjusts as learning proceeds. the weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection. artificial neurons may have a threshold such that the signal is only sent if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold. typically, artificial neurons are aggregated into layers. different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs. signals travel from the first layer (the input layer), to the last layer (the output layer), possibly after traversing the layers multiple times.\n",
      "the original goal of the ann approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would. however, over time, attention moved to performing specific tasks, leading to deviations from biology. artificial neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks, including computer vision, speech recognition, machine translation, social network filtering, playing board and video games and medical diagnosis.\n",
      "warren mcculloch and walter pitts[4] (1943) created a computational model for neural networks based on mathematics and algorithms called threshold logic. this model paved the way for neural network research to split into two approaches. one approach focused on biological processes in the brain while the other focused on the application of neural networks to artificial intelligence. this work led to work on nerve networks and their link to finite automata.[5]\n",
      "in the late 1940s, d. o. hebb[6] created a learning hypothesis based on the mechanism of neural plasticity that became known as hebbian learning. hebbian learning is unsupervised learning. this evolved into models for long term potentiation. researchers started applying these ideas to computational models in 1948 with turing's b-type machines. farley and clark[7] (1954) first used computational machines, then called \"calculators\", to simulate a hebbian network. other neural network computational machines were created by rochester, holland, habit and duda (1956).[8] rosenblatt[9] (1958) created the perceptron, an algorithm for pattern recognition. with mathematical notation, rosenblatt described circuitry not in the basic perceptron, such as the exclusive-or circuit that could not be processed by neural networks at the time.[10] in 1959, a biological model proposed by nobel laureates hubel and wiesel was based on their discovery of two types of cells in the primary visual cortex: simple cells and complex cells.[11] the first functional networks with many layers were published by ivakhnenko and lapa in 1965, becoming the group method of data handling.[12][13][14]\n",
      "neural network research stagnated after machine learning research by minsky and papert (1969),[15] who discovered two key issues with the computational machines that processed neural networks. the first was that basic perceptrons were incapable of processing the exclusive-or circuit. the second was that computers didn't have enough processing power to effectively handle the work required by large neural networks. neural network research slowed until computers achieved far greater processing power. much of artificial intelligence had focused on high-level (symbolic) models that are processed by using algorithms, characterized for example by expert systems with knowledge embodied in if-then rules, until in the late 1980s research expanded to low-level (sub-symbolic) machine learning, characterized by knowledge embodied in the parameters of a cognitive model.[citation needed]\n",
      "a key trigger for renewed interest in neural networks and learning was werbos's (1975) backpropagation algorithm that effectively solved the exclusive-or problem by making the training of multi-layer networks feasible and efficient. backpropagation distributed the error term back up through the layers, by modifying the weights at each node.[10]\n",
      "in the mid-1980s, parallel distributed processing became popular under the name connectionism. rumelhart and mcclelland (1986) described the use of connectionism to simulate neural processes.[16]\n",
      "support vector machines and other, much simpler methods such as linear classifiers gradually overtook neural networks in machine learning popularity. however, using neural networks transformed some domains, such as the prediction of protein structures.[17][18]\n",
      "in 1992, max-pooling was introduced to help with least shift invariance and tolerance to deformation to aid in 3d object recognition.[19][20][21]\n",
      "in 2010, backpropagation training through max-pooling was accelerated by gpus and shown to perform better than other pooling variants.[22]\n",
      "the vanishing gradient problem affects many-layered feedforward networks that used backpropagation and also recurrent neural networks (rnns).[23][24] as errors propagate from layer to layer, they shrink exponentially with the number of layers, impeding the tuning of neuron weights that is based on those errors, particularly affecting deep networks.\n",
      "to overcome this problem, schmidhuber adopted a multi-level hierarchy of networks (1992) pre-trained one level at a time by unsupervised learning and fine-tuned by backpropagation.[25] behnke (2003) relied only on the sign of the gradient (rprop)[26] on problems such as image reconstruction and face localization.\n",
      "hinton et al. (2006) proposed learning a high-level representation using successive layers of binary or real-valued latent variables with a restricted boltzmann machine[27] to model each layer. once sufficiently many layers have been learned, the deep architecture may be used as a generative model by reproducing the data when sampling down the model (an \"ancestral pass\") from the top level feature activations.[28][29] in 2012, ng and dean created a network that learned to recognize higher-level concepts, such as cats, only from watching unlabeled images taken from youtube videos.[30]\n",
      "earlier challenges in training deep neural networks were successfully addressed with methods such as unsupervised pre-training, while available computing power increased through the use of gpus and distributed computing. neural networks were deployed on a large scale, particularly in image and visual recognition problems. this became known as \"deep learning\".[citation needed]\n",
      "computational devices were created in cmos, for both biophysical simulation and neuromorphic computing. nanodevices[31] for very large scale principal components analyses and convolution may create a new class of neural computing because they are fundamentally analog rather than digital (even though the first implementations may use digital devices).[32] ciresan and colleagues (2010)[33] in schmidhuber's group showed that despite the vanishing gradient problem, gpus make back-propagation feasible for many-layered feedforward neural networks.\n",
      "between 2009 and 2012, recurrent neural networks and deep feedforward neural networks developed in schmidhuber's research group won eight international competitions in pattern recognition and machine learning.[34][35] for example, the bi-directional and multi-dimensional long short-term memory (lstm)[36][37][38][39] of graves et al. won three competitions in connected handwriting recognition at the 2009 international conference on document analysis and recognition (icdar), without any prior knowledge about the three languages to be learned.[38][37]\n",
      "ciresan and colleagues won pattern recognition contests, including the ijcnn 2011 traffic sign recognition competition,[40] the isbi 2012 segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopy stacks challenge[41] and others. their neural networks were the first pattern recognizers to achieve human-competitive or even superhuman performance[42] on benchmarks such as traffic sign recognition (ijcnn 2012), or the mnist handwritten digits problem.\n",
      "researchers demonstrated (2010) that deep neural networks interfaced to a hidden markov model with context-dependent states that define the neural network output layer can drastically reduce errors in large-vocabulary speech recognition tasks such as voice search.\n",
      "gpu-based implementations[43] of this approach won many pattern recognition contests, including the ijcnn 2011 traffic sign recognition competition,[40] the isbi 2012 segmentation of neuronal structures in em stacks challenge,[41] the imagenet competition[44] and others.\n",
      "deep, highly nonlinear neural architectures similar to the neocognitron[45] and the \"standard architecture of vision\",[46] inspired by simple and complex cells, were pre-trained by unsupervised methods by hinton.[47][28] a team from his lab won a 2012 contest sponsored by merck to design software to help find molecules that might identify new drugs.[48]\n",
      "as of 2011[update], the state of the art in deep learning feedforward networks alternated between convolutional layers and max-pooling layers,[43][49] topped by several fully or sparsely connected layers followed by a final classification layer. learning is usually done without unsupervised pre-training. in the convolutional layer, there are filters that are convolved with the input. each filter is equivalent to a weights vector that has to be trained.\n",
      "such supervised deep learning methods were the first to achieve human-competitive performance on certain tasks.[42]\n",
      "artificial neural networks were able to guarantee shift invariance to deal with small and large natural objects in large cluttered scenes, only when invariance extended beyond shift, to all ann-learned concepts, such as location, type (object class label), scale, lighting and others. this was realized in developmental networks (dns)[50] whose embodiments are where-what networks, wwn-1 (2008)[51] through wwn-7 (2013).[52]\n",

      "two modes of learning are available: stochastic and batch. in stochastic learning, each input creates a weight adjustment. in batch learning weights are adjusted based on a batch of inputs, accumulating errors over the batch. stochastic learning introduces \"noise\" into the gradient descent process, using the local gradient calculated from one data point; this reduces the chance of the network getting stuck in local minima. however, batch learning typically yields a faster, more stable descent to a local minimum, since each update is performed in the direction of the average error of the batch. a common compromise choice is to use \"mini-batches\", meaning small batches and with samples in each batch selected stochastically from the entire data set.\n",

      "a convolutional neural network (cnn) is a class of deep, feed-forward networks, composed of one or more convolutional layers with fully connected layers (matching those in typical artificial neural networks) on top. it uses tied weights and pooling layers. in particular, max-pooling[20] is often structured via fukushima's convolutional architecture.[100] this architecture allows cnns to take advantage of the 2d structure of input data.\n",
      "cnns are suitable for processing visual and other two-dimensional data.[101][102] they have shown superior results in both image and speech applications. they can be trained with standard backpropagation. cnns are easier to train than other regular, deep, feed-forward neural networks and have many fewer parameters to estimate.[103] examples of applications in computer vision include deepdream[104] and robot navigation.[105]\n",
      "a recent development has been that of capsule neural network (capsnet), the idea behind which is to add structures called capsules to a cnn and to reuse output from several of those capsules to form more stable (with respect to various perturbations) representations for higher order capsules.[106]\n",
      "long short-term memory (lstm) networks are rnns that avoid the vanishing gradient problem.[107] lstm is normally augmented by recurrent gates called forget gates.[108] lstm networks prevent backpropagated errors from vanishing or exploding.[23] instead errors can flow backwards through unlimited numbers of virtual layers in space-unfolded lstm. that is, lstm can learn \"very deep learning\" tasks[12] that require memories of events that happened thousands or even millions of discrete time steps ago. problem-specific lstm-like topologies can be evolved.[109] lstm can handle long delays and signals that have a mix of low and high frequency components.\n",
      "stacks of lstm rnns[110] trained by connectionist temporal classification (ctc)[111] can find an rnn weight matrix that maximizes the probability of the label sequences in a training set, given the corresponding input sequences. ctc achieves both alignment and recognition.\n",
      "in 2003, lstm started to become competitive with traditional speech recognizers.[112] in 2007, the combination with ctc achieved first good results on speech data.[113] in 2009, a ctc-trained lstm was the first rnn to win pattern recognition contests, when it won several competitions in connected handwriting recognition.[12][38] in 2014, baidu used ctc-trained rnns to break the switchboard hub5'00 speech recognition benchmark, without traditional speech processing methods.[114] lstm also improved large-vocabulary speech recognition,[115][116] text-to-speech synthesis,[117] for google android,[57][118] and photo-real talking heads.[119] in 2015, google's speech recognition experienced a 49% improvement through ctc-trained lstm.[120]\n",
      "lstm became popular in natural language processing. unlike previous models based on hmms and similar concepts, lstm can learn to recognise context-sensitive languages.[121] lstm improved machine translation,[122][123] language modeling[124] and multilingual language processing.[125] lstm combined with cnns improved automatic image captioning.[126]\n",

      "a deep belief network (dbn) is a probabilistic, generative model made up of multiple layers of hidden units. it can be considered a composition of simple learning modules that make up each layer.[129]\n",
      "a dbn can be used to generatively pre-train a dnn by using the learned dbn weights as the initial dnn weights. backpropagation or other discriminative algorithms can then tune these weights. this is particularly helpful when training data are limited, because poorly initialized weights can significantly hinder model performance. these pre-trained weights are in a region of the weight space that is closer to the optimal weights than were they randomly chosen. this allows for both improved modeling and faster convergence of the fine-tuning phase.[130]\n",
      "large memory storage and retrieval neural networks (lamstar)[131][132] are fast deep learning neural networks of many layers that can use many filters simultaneously. these filters may be nonlinear, stochastic, logic, non-stationary, or even non-analytical. they are biologically motivated and learn continuously.\n",
      "a lamstar neural network may serve as a dynamic neural network in spatial or time domains or both. its speed is provided by hebbian link-weights[133] that integrate the various and usually different filters (preprocessing functions) into its many layers and to dynamically rank the significance of the various layers and functions relative to a given learning task. this grossly imitates biological learning which integrates various preprocessors (cochlea, retina, etc.) and cortexes (auditory, visual, etc.) and their various regions. its deep learning capability is further enhanced by using inhibition, correlation and its ability to cope with incomplete data, or \"lost\" neurons or layers even amidst a task. it is fully transparent due to its link weights. the link-weights allow dynamic determination of innovation and redundancy, and facilitate the ranking of layers, of filters or of individual neurons relative to a task.\n",
      "lamstar has been applied to many domains, including medical[134][135][136] and financial predictions,[137] adaptive filtering of noisy speech in unknown noise,[138] still-image recognition,[139] video image recognition,[140] software security[141] and adaptive control of non-linear systems.[142] lamstar had a much faster learning speed and somewhat lower error rate than a cnn based on relu-function filters and max pooling, in 20 comparative studies.[143]\n",
      "these applications demonstrate delving into aspects of the data that are hidden from shallow learning networks and the human senses, such as in the cases of predicting onset of sleep apnea events,[135] of an electrocardiogram of a fetus as recorded from skin-surface electrodes placed on the mother's abdomen early in pregnancy,[136] of financial prediction[131] or in blind filtering of noisy speech.[138]\n",
      "lamstar was proposed in 1996 (a u.s. patent 5,920,852 a) and was further developed graupe and kordylewski from 1997–2002.[144][145][146] a modified version, known as lamstar 2, was developed by schneider and graupe in 2008.[147][148]\n",

      "this architecture is a dsn extension. it offers two important improvements: it uses higher-order information from covariance statistics, and it transforms the non-convex problem of a lower-layer to a convex sub-problem of an upper-layer.[155] tdsns use covariance statistics in a bilinear mapping from each of two distinct sets of hidden units in the same layer to predictions, via a third-order tensor.\n",

      "a deep predictive coding network (dpcn) is a predictive coding scheme that uses top-down information to empirically adjust the priors needed for a bottom-up inference procedure by means of a deep, locally connected, generative model. this works by extracting sparse features from time-varying observations using a linear dynamical model. then, a pooling strategy is used to learn invariant feature representations. these units compose to form a deep architecture and are trained by greedy layer-wise unsupervised learning. the layers constitute a kind of markov chain such that the states at any layer depend only on the preceding and succeeding layers.\n",
      "dpcns predict the representation of the layer, by using a top-down approach using the information in upper layer and temporal dependencies from previous states.[177]\n",
      "dpcns can be extended to form a convolutional network.[177]\n",
      "integrating external memory with artificial neural networks dates to early research in distributed representations[178] and kohonen's self-organizing maps. for example, in sparse distributed memory or hierarchical temporal memory, the patterns encoded by neural networks are used as addresses for content-addressable memory, with \"neurons\" essentially serving as address encoders and decoders. however, the early controllers of such memories were not differentiable.\n",
      "apart from long short-term memory (lstm), other approaches also added differentiable memory to recurrent functions. for example:\n",
      "neural turing machines[186] couple lstm networks to external memory resources, with which they can interact by attentional processes. the combined system is analogous to a turing machine but is differentiable end-to-end, allowing it to be efficiently trained by gradient descent. preliminary results demonstrate that neural turing machines can infer simple algorithms such as copying, sorting and associative recall from input and output examples.\n",
      "differentiable neural computers (dnc) are an ntm extension. they out-performed neural turing machines, long short-term memory systems and memory networks on sequence-processing tasks.[187][188][189][190][191]\n",
      "approaches that represent previous experiences directly and use a similar experience to form a local model are often called nearest neighbour or k-nearest neighbors methods.[192] deep learning is useful in semantic hashing[193] where a deep graphical model the word-count vectors[194] obtained from a large set of documents.[clarification needed] documents are mapped to memory addresses in such a way that semantically similar documents are located at nearby addresses. documents similar to a query document can then be found by accessing all the addresses that differ by only a few bits from the address of the query document. unlike sparse distributed memory that operates on 1000-bit addresses, semantic hashing works on 32 or 64-bit addresses found in a conventional computer architecture.\n",
      "memory networks[195][196] are another extension to neural networks incorporating long-term memory. the long-term memory can be read and written to, with the goal of using it for prediction. these models have been applied in the context of question answering (qa) where the long-term memory effectively acts as a (dynamic) knowledge base and the output is a textual response.[197] a team of electrical and computer engineers from ucla samueli school of engineering has created a physical artificial neural network that can analyze large volumes of data and identify objects at the actual speed of light.[198]\n",
      "deep neural networks can be potentially improved by deepening and parameter reduction, while maintaining trainability. while training extremely deep (e.g., 1 million layers) neural networks might not be practical, cpu-like architectures such as pointer networks[199] and neural random-access machines[200] overcome this limitation by using external random-access memory and other components that typically belong to a computer architecture such as registers, alu and pointers. such systems operate on probability distribution vectors stored in memory cells and registers. thus, the model is fully differentiable and trains end-to-end. the key characteristic of these models is that their depth, the size of their short-term memory, and the number of parameters can be altered independently – unlike models like lstm, whose number of parameters grows quadratically with memory size.\n",
      "encoder–decoder frameworks are based on neural networks that map highly structured input to highly structured output. the approach arose in the context of machine translation,[201][202][203] where the input and output are written sentences in two natural languages. in that work, an lstm rnn or cnn was used as an encoder to summarize a source sentence, and the summary was decoded using a conditional rnn language model to produce the translation.[204] these systems share building blocks: gated rnns and cnns and trained attention mechanisms.\n",

      "a more straightforward way to use kernel machines for deep learning was developed for spoken language understanding.[207] the main idea is to use a kernel machine to approximate a shallow neural net with an infinite number of hidden units, then use stacking to splice the output of the kernel machine and the raw input in building the next, higher level of the kernel machine. the number of levels in the deep convex network is a hyper-parameter of the overall system, to be determined by cross validation.\n",

      "application areas include system identification and control (vehicle control, trajectory prediction,[209] process control, natural resource management), quantum chemistry,[210] general game playing,[211] pattern recognition (radar systems, face identification, signal classification,[212] 3d reconstruction,[213] object recognition and more), sequence recognition (gesture, speech, handwritten and printed text recognition), medical diagnosis, finance[214] (e.g. automated trading systems), data mining, visualization, machine translation, social network filtering[215] and e-mail spam filtering.\n",
      "artificial neural networks have been used to diagnose cancers, including lung cancer,[216] prostate cancer, colorectal cancer[217] and to distinguish highly invasive cancer cell lines from less invasive lines using only cell shape information.[218][219]\n",
      "artificial neural networks have been used to accelerate reliability analysis of infrastructures subject to natural disasters[220][221] and to predict foundation settlements.[222]\n",
      "artificial neural networks have also been used for building black-box models in geoscience: hydrology,[223][224] ocean modelling and coastal engineering,[225][226] and geomorphology.[227]\n",
      "artificial neural networks have been employed with some success also in cybersecurity, with the objective to discriminate between legitimate activities and malicious ones. for example, machine learning has been used for classifying android malware,[228] for identifying domains belonging to threat actors[229] and for detecting urls posing a security risk.[230] research is being carried out also on ann systems designed for penetration testing,[231] for detecting botnets,[232] credit cards frauds,[233] network intrusions and, more in general, potentially infected machines.\n",
      "many types of models are used, defined at different levels of abstraction and modeling different aspects of neural systems. they range from models of the short-term behavior of individual neurons,[234] models of how the dynamics of neural circuitry arise from interactions between individual neurons and finally to models of how behavior can arise from abstract neural modules that represent complete subsystems. these include models of the long-term, and short-term plasticity, of neural systems and their relations to learning and memory from the individual neuron to the system level.\n",
      "the multilayer perceptron is a universal function approximator, as proven by the universal approximation theorem. however, the proof is not constructive regarding the number of neurons required, the network topology, the weights and the learning parameters.\n",
      "a specific recurrent architecture with rational valued weights (as opposed to full precision real number-valued weights) has the full power of a universal turing machine,[235] using a finite number of neurons and standard linear connections. further, the use of irrational values for weights results in a machine with super-turing power.[236]\n",
      "models' \"capacity\" property roughly corresponds to their ability to model any given function. it is related to the amount of information that can be stored in the network and to the notion of complexity.[citation needed]\n",
      "models may not consistently converge on a single solution, firstly because many local minima may exist, depending on the cost function and the model. secondly, the optimization method used might not guarantee to converge when it begins far from any local minimum. thirdly, for sufficiently large data or parameters, some methods become impractical. however, for cmac neural network, a recursive least squares algorithm was introduced to train it, and this algorithm can be guaranteed to converge in one step.[93]\n",
      "applications whose goal is to create a system that generalizes well to unseen examples, face the possibility of over-training. this arises in convoluted or over-specified systems when the capacity of the network significantly exceeds the needed free parameters. two approaches address over-training. the first is to use cross-validation and similar techniques to check for the presence of over-training and optimally select hyperparameters to minimize the generalization error. the second is to use some form of regularization. this concept emerges in a probabilistic (bayesian) framework, where regularization can be performed by selecting a larger prior probability over simpler models; but also in statistical learning theory, where the goal is to minimize over two quantities: the 'empirical risk' and the 'structural risk', which roughly corresponds to the error over the training set and the predicted error in unseen data due to overfitting.\n",
      "supervised neural networks that use a mean squared error (mse) cost function can use formal statistical methods to determine the confidence of the trained model. the mse on a validation set can be used as an estimate for variance. this value can then be used to calculate the confidence interval of the output of the network, assuming a normal distribution. a confidence analysis made this way is statistically valid as long as the output probability distribution stays the same and the network is not modified.\n",
      "by assigning a softmax activation function, a generalization of the logistic function, on the output layer of the neural network (or a softmax component in a component-based neural network) for categorical target variables, the outputs can be interpreted as posterior probabilities. this is very useful in classification as it gives a certainty measure on classifications.\n",
      "the softmax activation function is:\n",
      "\n",
      "a common criticism of neural networks, particularly in robotics, is that they require too much training for real-world operation.[citation needed] potential solutions include randomly shuffling training examples, by using a numerical optimization algorithm that does not take too large steps when changing the network connections following an example and by grouping examples in so-called mini-batches. improving the training efficiency and convergence capability has always been an ongoing research area for neural network. for example, by introducing a recursive least squares algorithm for cmac neural network, the training process only takes one step to converge.[93]\n",
      "a fundamental objection is that they do not reflect how real neurons function. back propagation is a critical part of most artificial neural networks, although no such mechanism exists in biological neural networks.[237] how information is coded by real neurons is not known. sensor neurons fire action potentials more frequently with sensor activation and muscle cells pull more strongly when their associated motor neurons receive action potentials more frequently.[238] other than the case of relaying information from a sensor neuron to a motor neuron, almost nothing of the principles of how information is handled by biological neural networks is known. this is a subject of active research in neural coding.\n",
      "the motivation behind artificial neural networks is not necessarily to strictly replicate neural function, but to use biological neural networks as an inspiration. a central claim of artificial neural networks is therefore that it embodies some new and powerful general principle for processing information. unfortunately, these general principles are ill-defined. it is often claimed that they are emergent from the network itself. this allows simple statistical association (the basic function of artificial neural networks) to be described as learning or recognition. alexander dewdney commented that, as a result, artificial neural networks have a \"something-for-nothing quality, one that imparts a peculiar aura of laziness and a distinct lack of curiosity about just how good these computing systems are. no human hand (or mind) intervenes; solutions are found as if by magic; and no one, it seems, has learned anything\".[239]\n",
      "biological brains use both shallow and deep circuits as reported by brain anatomy,[240] displaying a wide variety of invariance. weng[241] argued that the brain self-wires largely according to signal statistics and therefore, a serial cascade cannot catch all major statistical dependencies.\n",
      "large and effective neural networks require considerable computing resources.[242] while the brain has hardware tailored to the task of processing signals through a graph of neurons, simulating even a simplified neuron on von neumann architecture may compel a neural network designer to fill many millions of database rows for its connections –  which can consume vast amounts of memory and storage. furthermore, the designer often needs to transmit signals through many of these connections and their associated neurons –  which must often be matched with enormous cpu processing power and time.\n",
      "schmidhuber notes that the resurgence of neural networks in the twenty-first century is largely attributable to advances in hardware: from 1991 to 2015, computing power, especially as delivered by gpgpus (on gpus), has increased around a million-fold, making the standard backpropagation algorithm feasible for training networks that are several layers deeper than before.[243] the use of accelerators such as fpgas and gpus can reduce training times from months to days.[244][242]\n",
      "neuromorphic engineering addresses the hardware difficulty directly, by constructing non-von-neumann chips to directly implement neural networks in circuitry. another chip optimized for neural network processing is called a tensor processing unit, or tpu.[245]\n",
      "arguments against dewdney's position are that neural networks have been successfully used to solve many complex and diverse tasks, ranging from autonomously flying aircraft[246] to detecting credit card fraud to mastering the game of go.\n",
      "technology writer roger bridgman commented:\n",
      "although it is true that analyzing what has been learned by an artificial neural network is difficult, it is much easier to do so than to analyze what has been learned by a biological neural network. furthermore, researchers involved in exploring learning algorithms for neural networks are gradually uncovering general principles that allow a learning machine to be successful. for example, local vs non-local learning and shallow vs deep architecture.[248]\n",
      "advocates of hybrid models (combining neural networks and symbolic approaches), claim that such a mixture can better capture the mechanisms of the human mind.[249][250]\n",
      "artificial neural networks have many variations. the simplest, static types have one or more static components, including number of units, number of layers, unit weights and topology. dynamic types allow one or more of these to change during the learning process. the latter are much more complicated, but can shorten learning periods and produce better results. some types allow/require learning to be \"supervised\" by the operator, while others operate independently. some types operate purely in hardware, while others are purely software and run on general purpose computers.\n",

      "data mining  is the process of discovering patterns in large data sets involving methods at the intersection of machine learning, statistics, and database systems.[1] data mining is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and statistics with an overall goal to extract information (with intelligent methods) from a data set and transform the information into a comprehensible structure for further use.[1][2][3][4] data mining is the analysis step of the \"knowledge discovery in databases\" process, or kdd.[5] aside from the raw analysis step, it also involves database and data management aspects, data pre-processing, model and inference considerations, interestingness metrics, complexity considerations, post-processing of discovered structures, visualization, and online updating.[1] the difference between data analysis and data mining is that data analysis is used to test models and hypotheses on the dataset, e.g., analyzing the effectiveness of a marketing campaign, regardless of the amount of data; in contrast, data mining uses machine-learning and statistical models to uncover clandestine or hidden patterns in a large volume of data.[6]\n",
      "the term \"data mining\" is in fact a misnomer, because the goal is the extraction of patterns and knowledge from large amounts of data, not the extraction (mining) of data itself.[7] it also is a buzzword[8] and is frequently applied to any form of large-scale data or information processing (collection, extraction, warehousing, analysis, and statistics) as well as any application of computer decision support system, including artificial intelligence (e.g., machine learning) and business intelligence. the book data mining: practical machine learning tools and techniques with java[9] (which covers mostly machine learning material) was originally to be named just practical machine learning, and the term data mining was only added for marketing reasons.[10] often the more general terms (large scale) data analysis and analytics – or, when referring to actual methods, artificial intelligence and machine learning – are more appropriate.\n",
      "the actual data mining task is the semi-automatic or automatic analysis of large quantities of data to extract previously unknown, interesting patterns such as groups of data records (cluster analysis), unusual records (anomaly detection), and dependencies (association rule mining, sequential pattern mining). this usually involves using database techniques such as spatial indices. these patterns can then be seen as a kind of summary of the input data, and may be used in further analysis or, for example, in machine learning and predictive analytics. for example, the data mining step might identify multiple groups in the data, which can then be used to obtain more accurate prediction results by a decision support system. neither the data collection, data preparation, nor result interpretation and reporting is part of the data mining step, but do belong to the overall kdd process as additional steps.\n",
      "the related terms data dredging, data fishing, and data snooping refer to the use of data mining methods to sample parts of a larger population data set that are (or may be) too small for reliable statistical inferences to be made about the validity of any patterns discovered. these methods can, however, be used in creating new hypotheses to test against the larger data populations.\n",

      "artificial neural networks (ann) or connectionist systems are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains.[1][2] the neural network itself is not an algorithm, but rather a framework for many different machine learning algorithms to work together and process complex data inputs.[3] such systems \"learn\" to perform tasks by considering examples, generally without being programmed with any task-specific rules. for example, in image recognition, they might learn to identify images that contain cats by analyzing example images that have been manually labeled as \"cat\" or \"no cat\" and using the results to identify cats in other images. they do this without any prior knowledge about cats, for example, that they have fur, tails, whiskers and cat-like faces. instead, they automatically generate identifying characteristics from the learning material that they process.\n",
      "an ann is based on a collection of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. each connection, like the synapses in a biological brain, can transmit a signal from one artificial neuron to another. an artificial neuron that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional artificial neurons connected to it.\n",
      "in common ann implementations, the signal at a connection between artificial neurons is a real number, and the output of each artificial neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs. the connections between artificial neurons are called 'edges'. artificial neurons and edges typically have a weight that adjusts as learning proceeds. the weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection. artificial neurons may have a threshold such that the signal is only sent if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold. typically, artificial neurons are aggregated into layers. different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs. signals travel from the first layer (the input layer), to the last layer (the output layer), possibly after traversing the layers multiple times.\n",
      "the original goal of the ann approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would. however, over time, attention moved to performing specific tasks, leading to deviations from biology. artificial neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks, including computer vision, speech recognition, machine translation, social network filtering, playing board and video games and medical diagnosis.\n",
      "warren mcculloch and walter pitts[4] (1943) created a computational model for neural networks based on mathematics and algorithms called threshold logic. this model paved the way for neural network research to split into two approaches. one approach focused on biological processes in the brain while the other focused on the application of neural networks to artificial intelligence. this work led to work on nerve networks and their link to finite automata.[5]\n",
      "in the late 1940s, d. o. hebb[6] created a learning hypothesis based on the mechanism of neural plasticity that became known as hebbian learning. hebbian learning is unsupervised learning. this evolved into models for long term potentiation. researchers started applying these ideas to computational models in 1948 with turing's b-type machines. farley and clark[7] (1954) first used computational machines, then called \"calculators\", to simulate a hebbian network. other neural network computational machines were created by rochester, holland, habit and duda (1956).[8] rosenblatt[9] (1958) created the perceptron, an algorithm for pattern recognition. with mathematical notation, rosenblatt described circuitry not in the basic perceptron, such as the exclusive-or circuit that could not be processed by neural networks at the time.[10] in 1959, a biological model proposed by nobel laureates hubel and wiesel was based on their discovery of two types of cells in the primary visual cortex: simple cells and complex cells.[11] the first functional networks with many layers were published by ivakhnenko and lapa in 1965, becoming the group method of data handling.[12][13][14]\n",
      "neural network research stagnated after machine learning research by minsky and papert (1969),[15] who discovered two key issues with the computational machines that processed neural networks. the first was that basic perceptrons were incapable of processing the exclusive-or circuit. the second was that computers didn't have enough processing power to effectively handle the work required by large neural networks. neural network research slowed until computers achieved far greater processing power. much of artificial intelligence had focused on high-level (symbolic) models that are processed by using algorithms, characterized for example by expert systems with knowledge embodied in if-then rules, until in the late 1980s research expanded to low-level (sub-symbolic) machine learning, characterized by knowledge embodied in the parameters of a cognitive model.[citation needed]\n",
      "a key trigger for renewed interest in neural networks and learning was werbos's (1975) backpropagation algorithm that effectively solved the exclusive-or problem by making the training of multi-layer networks feasible and efficient. backpropagation distributed the error term back up through the layers, by modifying the weights at each node.[10]\n",
      "in the mid-1980s, parallel distributed processing became popular under the name connectionism. rumelhart and mcclelland (1986) described the use of connectionism to simulate neural processes.[16]\n",
      "support vector machines and other, much simpler methods such as linear classifiers gradually overtook neural networks in machine learning popularity. however, using neural networks transformed some domains, such as the prediction of protein structures.[17][18]\n",
      "in 1992, max-pooling was introduced to help with least shift invariance and tolerance to deformation to aid in 3d object recognition.[19][20][21]\n",
      "in 2010, backpropagation training through max-pooling was accelerated by gpus and shown to perform better than other pooling variants.[22]\n",
      "the vanishing gradient problem affects many-layered feedforward networks that used backpropagation and also recurrent neural networks (rnns).[23][24] as errors propagate from layer to layer, they shrink exponentially with the number of layers, impeding the tuning of neuron weights that is based on those errors, particularly affecting deep networks.\n",
      "to overcome this problem, schmidhuber adopted a multi-level hierarchy of networks (1992) pre-trained one level at a time by unsupervised learning and fine-tuned by backpropagation.[25] behnke (2003) relied only on the sign of the gradient (rprop)[26] on problems such as image reconstruction and face localization.\n",
      "hinton et al. (2006) proposed learning a high-level representation using successive layers of binary or real-valued latent variables with a restricted boltzmann machine[27] to model each layer. once sufficiently many layers have been learned, the deep architecture may be used as a generative model by reproducing the data when sampling down the model (an \"ancestral pass\") from the top level feature activations.[28][29] in 2012, ng and dean created a network that learned to recognize higher-level concepts, such as cats, only from watching unlabeled images taken from youtube videos.[30]\n",
      "earlier challenges in training deep neural networks were successfully addressed with methods such as unsupervised pre-training, while available computing power increased through the use of gpus and distributed computing. neural networks were deployed on a large scale, particularly in image and visual recognition problems. this became known as \"deep learning\".[citation needed]\n",
      "computational devices were created in cmos, for both biophysical simulation and neuromorphic computing. nanodevices[31] for very large scale principal components analyses and convolution may create a new class of neural computing because they are fundamentally analog rather than digital (even though the first implementations may use digital devices).[32] ciresan and colleagues (2010)[33] in schmidhuber's group showed that despite the vanishing gradient problem, gpus make back-propagation feasible for many-layered feedforward neural networks.\n",
      "between 2009 and 2012, recurrent neural networks and deep feedforward neural networks developed in schmidhuber's research group won eight international competitions in pattern recognition and machine learning.[34][35] for example, the bi-directional and multi-dimensional long short-term memory (lstm)[36][37][38][39] of graves et al. won three competitions in connected handwriting recognition at the 2009 international conference on document analysis and recognition (icdar), without any prior knowledge about the three languages to be learned.[38][37]\n",
      "ciresan and colleagues won pattern recognition contests, including the ijcnn 2011 traffic sign recognition competition,[40] the isbi 2012 segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopy stacks challenge[41] and others. their neural networks were the first pattern recognizers to achieve human-competitive or even superhuman performance[42] on benchmarks such as traffic sign recognition (ijcnn 2012), or the mnist handwritten digits problem.\n",
      "researchers demonstrated (2010) that deep neural networks interfaced to a hidden markov model with context-dependent states that define the neural network output layer can drastically reduce errors in large-vocabulary speech recognition tasks such as voice search.\n",
      "gpu-based implementations[43] of this approach won many pattern recognition contests, including the ijcnn 2011 traffic sign recognition competition,[40] the isbi 2012 segmentation of neuronal structures in em stacks challenge,[41] the imagenet competition[44] and others.\n",
      "deep, highly nonlinear neural architectures similar to the neocognitron[45] and the \"standard architecture of vision\",[46] inspired by simple and complex cells, were pre-trained by unsupervised methods by hinton.[47][28] a team from his lab won a 2012 contest sponsored by merck to design software to help find molecules that might identify new drugs.[48]\n",
      "as of 2011[update], the state of the art in deep learning feedforward networks alternated between convolutional layers and max-pooling layers,[43][49] topped by several fully or sparsely connected layers followed by a final classification layer. learning is usually done without unsupervised pre-training. in the convolutional layer, there are filters that are convolved with the input. each filter is equivalent to a weights vector that has to be trained.\n",
      "such supervised deep learning methods were the first to achieve human-competitive performance on certain tasks.[42]\n",
      "artificial neural networks were able to guarantee shift invariance to deal with small and large natural objects in large cluttered scenes, only when invariance extended beyond shift, to all ann-learned concepts, such as location, type (object class label), scale, lighting and others. this was realized in developmental networks (dns)[50] whose embodiments are where-what networks, wwn-1 (2008)[51] through wwn-7 (2013).[52]\n",
      "an artificial neural network is a network of simple elements called artificial neurons, which receive input, change their internal state (activation) according to that input, and produce output depending on the input and activation.\n",
      "an artificial neuron mimics the working of a biophysical neuron with inputs and outputs, but is not a biological neuron model.\n",
      "the network forms by connecting the output of certain neurons to the input of other neurons forming a directed, weighted graph. the weights as well as the functions that compute the activation can be modified by a process called learning which is governed by a learning rule.[53]\n",

      "artificial neural networks are frequently used in reinforcement learning as part of the overall algorithm.[81][82] dynamic programming was coupled with artificial neural networks (giving neurodynamic programming) by bertsekas and tsitsiklis[83] and applied to multi-dimensional nonlinear problems such as those involved in vehicle routing,[84] natural resources management[85][86] or medicine[87] because of the ability of artificial neural networks to mitigate losses of accuracy even when reducing the discretization grid density for numerically approximating the solution of the original control problems.\n",

      "training a neural network model essentially means selecting one model from the set of allowed models (or, in a bayesian framework, determining a distribution over the set of allowed models) that minimizes the cost. numerous algorithms are available for training neural network models; most of them can be viewed as a straightforward application of optimization theory and statistical estimation.\n",

      "the optimization algorithm repeats a two phase cycle, propagation and weight update. when an input vector is presented to the network, it is propagated forward through the network, layer by layer, until it reaches the output layer. the output of the network is then compared to the desired output, using a loss function. the resulting error value is calculated for each of the neurons in the output layer. the error values are then propagated from the output back through the network, until each neuron has an associated error value that reflects its contribution to the original output.\n",
      "backpropagation uses these error values to calculate the gradient of the loss function. in the second phase, this gradient is fed to the optimization method, which in turn uses it to update the weights, in an attempt to minimize the loss function.\n",

      "large memory storage and retrieval neural networks (lamstar)[131][132] are fast deep learning neural networks of many layers that can use many filters simultaneously. these filters may be nonlinear, stochastic, logic, non-stationary, or even non-analytical. they are biologically motivated and learn continuously.\n",
      "a lamstar neural network may serve as a dynamic neural network in spatial or time domains or both. its speed is provided by hebbian link-weights[133] that integrate the various and usually different filters (preprocessing functions) into its many layers and to dynamically rank the significance of the various layers and functions relative to a given learning task. this grossly imitates biological learning which integrates various preprocessors (cochlea, retina, etc.) and cortexes (auditory, visual, etc.) and their various regions. its deep learning capability is further enhanced by using inhibition, correlation and its ability to cope with incomplete data, or \"lost\" neurons or layers even amidst a task. it is fully transparent due to its link weights. the link-weights allow dynamic determination of innovation and redundancy, and facilitate the ranking of layers, of filters or of individual neurons relative to a task.\n",
      "lamstar has been applied to many domains, including medical[134][135][136] and financial predictions,[137] adaptive filtering of noisy speech in unknown noise,[138] still-image recognition,[139] video image recognition,[140] software security[141] and adaptive control of non-linear systems.[142] lamstar had a much faster learning speed and somewhat lower error rate than a cnn based on relu-function filters and max pooling, in 20 comparative studies.[143]\n",

      "the need for deep learning with real-valued inputs, as in gaussian restricted boltzmann machines, led to the spike-and-slab rbm (ssrbm), which models continuous-valued inputs with strictly binary latent variables.[159] similar to basic rbms and its variants, a spike-and-slab rbm is a bipartite graph, while like grbms, the visible units (input) are real-valued. the difference is in the hidden layer, where each hidden unit has a binary spike variable and a real-valued slab variable. a spike is a discrete probability mass at zero, while a slab is a density over continuous domain;[160] their mixture forms a prior.[161]\n",
      "an extension of ssrbm called µ-ssrbm provides extra modeling capacity using additional terms in the energy function. one of these terms enables the model to form a conditional distribution of the spike variables by marginalizing out the slab variables given an observation.\n",
      "compound hierarchical-deep models compose deep networks with non-parametric bayesian models. features can be learned using deep architectures such as dbns,[28] dbms,[162] deep auto encoders,[163] convolutional variants,[164][165] ssrbms,[160] deep coding networks,[166] dbns with sparse feature learning,[167] rnns,[168] conditional dbns,[169] de-noising auto encoders.[170] this provides a better representation, allowing faster learning and more accurate classification with high-dimensional data. however, these architectures are poor at learning novel classes with few examples, because all network units are involved in representing the input (a distributed representation) and must be adjusted together (high degree of freedom). limiting the degree of freedom reduces the number of parameters to learn, facilitating learning of new classes from few examples. hierarchical bayesian (hb) models allow learning from few examples, for example[171][172][173][174][175] for computer vision, statistics and cognitive science.\n",

      "differentiable neural computers (dnc) are an ntm extension. they out-performed neural turing machines, long short-term memory systems and memory networks on sequence-processing tasks.[187][188][189][190][191]\n",
      "approaches that represent previous experiences directly and use a similar experience to form a local model are often called nearest neighbour or k-nearest neighbors methods.[192] deep learning is useful in semantic hashing[193] where a deep graphical model the word-count vectors[194] obtained from a large set of documents.[clarification needed] documents are mapped to memory addresses in such a way that semantically similar documents are located at nearby addresses. documents similar to a query document can then be found by accessing all the addresses that differ by only a few bits from the address of the query document. unlike sparse distributed memory that operates on 1000-bit addresses, semantic hashing works on 32 or 64-bit addresses found in a conventional computer architecture.\n",
      "memory networks[195][196] are another extension to neural networks incorporating long-term memory. the long-term memory can be read and written to, with the goal of using it for prediction. these models have been applied in the context of question answering (qa) where the long-term memory effectively acts as a (dynamic) knowledge base and the output is a textual response.[197] a team of electrical and computer engineers from ucla samueli school of engineering has created a physical artificial neural network that can analyze large volumes of data and identify objects at the actual speed of light.[198]\n",
      "deep neural networks can be potentially improved by deepening and parameter reduction, while maintaining trainability. while training extremely deep (e.g., 1 million layers) neural networks might not be practical, cpu-like architectures such as pointer networks[199] and neural random-access machines[200] overcome this limitation by using external random-access memory and other components that typically belong to a computer architecture such as registers, alu and pointers. such systems operate on probability distribution vectors stored in memory cells and registers. thus, the model is fully differentiable and trains end-to-end. the key characteristic of these models is that their depth, the size of their short-term memory, and the number of parameters can be altered independently – unlike models like lstm, whose number of parameters grows quadratically with memory size.\n",
      "encoder–decoder frameworks are based on neural networks that map highly structured input to highly structured output. the approach arose in the context of machine translation,[201][202][203] where the input and output are written sentences in two natural languages. in that work, an lstm rnn or cnn was used as an encoder to summarize a source sentence, and the summary was decoded using a conditional rnn language model to produce the translation.[204] these systems share building blocks: gated rnns and cnns and trained attention mechanisms.\n",

      "models' \"capacity\" property roughly corresponds to their ability to model any given function. it is related to the amount of information that can be stored in the network and to the notion of complexity.[citation needed]\n",
      "models may not consistently converge on a single solution, firstly because many local minima may exist, depending on the cost function and the model. secondly, the optimization method used might not guarantee to converge when it begins far from any local minimum. thirdly, for sufficiently large data or parameters, some methods become impractical. however, for cmac neural network, a recursive least squares algorithm was introduced to train it, and this algorithm can be guaranteed to converge in one step.[93]\n",
      "applications whose goal is to create a system that generalizes well to unseen examples, face the possibility of over-training. this arises in convoluted or over-specified systems when the capacity of the network significantly exceeds the needed free parameters. two approaches address over-training. the first is to use cross-validation and similar techniques to check for the presence of over-training and optimally select hyperparameters to minimize the generalization error. the second is to use some form of regularization. this concept emerges in a probabilistic (bayesian) framework, where regularization can be performed by selecting a larger prior probability over simpler models; but also in statistical learning theory, where the goal is to minimize over two quantities: the 'empirical risk' and the 'structural risk', which roughly corresponds to the error over the training set and the predicted error in unseen data due to overfitting.\n",
      "supervised neural networks that use a mean squared error (mse) cost function can use formal statistical methods to determine the confidence of the trained model. the mse on a validation set can be used as an estimate for variance. this value can then be used to calculate the confidence interval of the output of the network, assuming a normal distribution. a confidence analysis made this way is statistically valid as long as the output probability distribution stays the same and the network is not modified.\n",

      "a common criticism of neural networks, particularly in robotics, is that they require too much training for real-world operation.[citation needed] potential solutions include randomly shuffling training examples, by using a numerical optimization algorithm that does not take too large steps when changing the network connections following an example and by grouping examples in so-called mini-batches. improving the training efficiency and convergence capability has always been an ongoing research area for neural network. for example, by introducing a recursive least squares algorithm for cmac neural network, the training process only takes one step to converge.[93]\n",
      "a fundamental objection is that they do not reflect how real neurons function. back propagation is a critical part of most artificial neural networks, although no such mechanism exists in biological neural networks.[237] how information is coded by real neurons is not known. sensor neurons fire action potentials more frequently with sensor activation and muscle cells pull more strongly when their associated motor neurons receive action potentials more frequently.[238] other than the case of relaying information from a sensor neuron to a motor neuron, almost nothing of the principles of how information is handled by biological neural networks is known. this is a subject of active research in neural coding.\n",
      "the motivation behind artificial neural networks is not necessarily to strictly replicate neural function, but to use biological neural networks as an inspiration. a central claim of artificial neural networks is therefore that it embodies some new and powerful general principle for processing information. unfortunately, these general principles are ill-defined. it is often claimed that they are emergent from the network itself. this allows simple statistical association (the basic function of artificial neural networks) to be described as learning or recognition. alexander dewdney commented that, as a result, artificial neural networks have a \"something-for-nothing quality, one that imparts a peculiar aura of laziness and a distinct lack of curiosity about just how good these computing systems are. no human hand (or mind) intervenes; solutions are found as if by magic; and no one, it seems, has learned anything\".[239]\n",
      "biological brains use both shallow and deep circuits as reported by brain anatomy,[240] displaying a wide variety of invariance. weng[241] argued that the brain self-wires largely according to signal statistics and therefore, a serial cascade cannot catch all major statistical dependencies.\n",
      "large and effective neural networks require considerable computing resources.[242] while the brain has hardware tailored to the task of processing signals through a graph of neurons, simulating even a simplified neuron on von neumann architecture may compel a neural network designer to fill many millions of database rows for its connections –  which can consume vast amounts of memory and storage. furthermore, the designer often needs to transmit signals through many of these connections and their associated neurons –  which must often be matched with enormous cpu processing power and time.\n",
      "schmidhuber notes that the resurgence of neural networks in the twenty-first century is largely attributable to advances in hardware: from 1991 to 2015, computing power, especially as delivered by gpgpus (on gpus), has increased around a million-fold, making the standard backpropagation algorithm feasible for training networks that are several layers deeper than before.[243] the use of accelerators such as fpgas and gpus can reduce training times from months to days.[244][242]\n",
      "neuromorphic engineering addresses the hardware difficulty directly, by constructing non-von-neumann chips to directly implement neural networks in circuitry. another chip optimized for neural network processing is called a tensor processing unit, or tpu.[245]\n",

      "technology writer roger bridgman commented:\n",
      "although it is true that analyzing what has been learned by an artificial neural network is difficult, it is much easier to do so than to analyze what has been learned by a biological neural network. furthermore, researchers involved in exploring learning algorithms for neural networks are gradually uncovering general principles that allow a learning machine to be successful. for example, local vs non-local learning and shallow vs deep architecture.[248]\n",
      "advocates of hybrid models (combining neural networks and symbolic approaches), claim that such a mixture can better capture the mechanisms of the human mind.[249][250]\n",
      "artificial neural networks have many variations. the simplest, static types have one or more static components, including number of units, number of layers, unit weights and topology. dynamic types allow one or more of these to change during the learning process. the latter are much more complicated, but can shorten learning periods and produce better results. some types allow/require learning to be \"supervised\" by the operator, while others operate independently. some types operate purely in hardware, while others are purely software and run on general purpose computers.\n",

      "artificial neural networks (ann) or connectionist systems are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains.[1][2] the neural network itself is not an algorithm, but rather a framework for many different machine learning algorithms to work together and process complex data inputs.[3] such systems \"learn\" to perform tasks by considering examples, generally without being programmed with any task-specific rules. for example, in image recognition, they might learn to identify images that contain cats by analyzing example images that have been manually labeled as \"cat\" or \"no cat\" and using the results to identify cats in other images. they do this without any prior knowledge about cats, for example, that they have fur, tails, whiskers and cat-like faces. instead, they automatically generate identifying characteristics from the learning material that they process.\n",
      "an ann is based on a collection of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. each connection, like the synapses in a biological brain, can transmit a signal from one artificial neuron to another. an artificial neuron that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional artificial neurons connected to it.\n",
      "in common ann implementations, the signal at a connection between artificial neurons is a real number, and the output of each artificial neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs. the connections between artificial neurons are called 'edges'. artificial neurons and edges typically have a weight that adjusts as learning proceeds. the weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection. artificial neurons may have a threshold such that the signal is only sent if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold. typically, artificial neurons are aggregated into layers. different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs. signals travel from the first layer (the input layer), to the last layer (the output layer), possibly after traversing the layers multiple times.\n",
      "the original goal of the ann approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would. however, over time, attention moved to performing specific tasks, leading to deviations from biology. artificial neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks, including computer vision, speech recognition, machine translation, social network filtering, playing board and video games and medical diagnosis.\n",
      "warren mcculloch and walter pitts[4] (1943) created a computational model for neural networks based on mathematics and algorithms called threshold logic. this model paved the way for neural network research to split into two approaches. one approach focused on biological processes in the brain while the other focused on the application of neural networks to artificial intelligence. this work led to work on nerve networks and their link to finite automata.[5]\n",
      "in the late 1940s, d. o. hebb[6] created a learning hypothesis based on the mechanism of neural plasticity that became known as hebbian learning. hebbian learning is unsupervised learning. this evolved into models for long term potentiation. researchers started applying these ideas to computational models in 1948 with turing's b-type machines. farley and clark[7] (1954) first used computational machines, then called \"calculators\", to simulate a hebbian network. other neural network computational machines were created by rochester, holland, habit and duda (1956).[8] rosenblatt[9] (1958) created the perceptron, an algorithm for pattern recognition. with mathematical notation, rosenblatt described circuitry not in the basic perceptron, such as the exclusive-or circuit that could not be processed by neural networks at the time.[10] in 1959, a biological model proposed by nobel laureates hubel and wiesel was based on their discovery of two types of cells in the primary visual cortex: simple cells and complex cells.[11] the first functional networks with many layers were published by ivakhnenko and lapa in 1965, becoming the group method of data handling.[12][13][14]\n",
      "neural network research stagnated after machine learning research by minsky and papert (1969),[15] who discovered two key issues with the computational machines that processed neural networks. the first was that basic perceptrons were incapable of processing the exclusive-or circuit. the second was that computers didn't have enough processing power to effectively handle the work required by large neural networks. neural network research slowed until computers achieved far greater processing power. much of artificial intelligence had focused on high-level (symbolic) models that are processed by using algorithms, characterized for example by expert systems with knowledge embodied in if-then rules, until in the late 1980s research expanded to low-level (sub-symbolic) machine learning, characterized by knowledge embodied in the parameters of a cognitive model.[citation needed]\n",
      "a key trigger for renewed interest in neural networks and learning was werbos's (1975) backpropagation algorithm that effectively solved the exclusive-or problem by making the training of multi-layer networks feasible and efficient. backpropagation distributed the error term back up through the layers, by modifying the weights at each node.[10]\n",
      "in the mid-1980s, parallel distributed processing became popular under the name connectionism. rumelhart and mcclelland (1986) described the use of connectionism to simulate neural processes.[16]\n",
      "support vector machines and other, much simpler methods such as linear classifiers gradually overtook neural networks in machine learning popularity. however, using neural networks transformed some domains, such as the prediction of protein structures.[17][18]\n",
      "in 1992, max-pooling was introduced to help with least shift invariance and tolerance to deformation to aid in 3d object recognition.[19][20][21]\n",
      "in 2010, backpropagation training through max-pooling was accelerated by gpus and shown to perform better than other pooling variants.[22]\n",
      "the vanishing gradient problem affects many-layered feedforward networks that used backpropagation and also recurrent neural networks (rnns).[23][24] as errors propagate from layer to layer, they shrink exponentially with the number of layers, impeding the tuning of neuron weights that is based on those errors, particularly affecting deep networks.\n",
      "to overcome this problem, schmidhuber adopted a multi-level hierarchy of networks (1992) pre-trained one level at a time by unsupervised learning and fine-tuned by backpropagation.[25] behnke (2003) relied only on the sign of the gradient (rprop)[26] on problems such as image reconstruction and face localization.\n",
      "hinton et al. (2006) proposed learning a high-level representation using successive layers of binary or real-valued latent variables with a restricted boltzmann machine[27] to model each layer. once sufficiently many layers have been learned, the deep architecture may be used as a generative model by reproducing the data when sampling down the model (an \"ancestral pass\") from the top level feature activations.[28][29] in 2012, ng and dean created a network that learned to recognize higher-level concepts, such as cats, only from watching unlabeled images taken from youtube videos.[30]\n",
      "earlier challenges in training deep neural networks were successfully addressed with methods such as unsupervised pre-training, while available computing power increased through the use of gpus and distributed computing. neural networks were deployed on a large scale, particularly in image and visual recognition problems. this became known as \"deep learning\".[citation needed]\n",
      "computational devices were created in cmos, for both biophysical simulation and neuromorphic computing. nanodevices[31] for very large scale principal components analyses and convolution may create a new class of neural computing because they are fundamentally analog rather than digital (even though the first implementations may use digital devices).[32] ciresan and colleagues (2010)[33] in schmidhuber's group showed that despite the vanishing gradient problem, gpus make back-propagation feasible for many-layered feedforward neural networks.\n",
      "between 2009 and 2012, recurrent neural networks and deep feedforward neural networks developed in schmidhuber's research group won eight international competitions in pattern recognition and machine learning.[34][35] for example, the bi-directional and multi-dimensional long short-term memory (lstm)[36][37][38][39] of graves et al. won three competitions in connected handwriting recognition at the 2009 international conference on document analysis and recognition (icdar), without any prior knowledge about the three languages to be learned.[38][37]\n",
      "ciresan and colleagues won pattern recognition contests, including the ijcnn 2011 traffic sign recognition competition,[40] the isbi 2012 segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopy stacks challenge[41] and others. their neural networks were the first pattern recognizers to achieve human-competitive or even superhuman performance[42] on benchmarks such as traffic sign recognition (ijcnn 2012), or the mnist handwritten digits problem.\n",
      "researchers demonstrated (2010) that deep neural networks interfaced to a hidden markov model with context-dependent states that define the neural network output layer can drastically reduce errors in large-vocabulary speech recognition tasks such as voice search.\n",
      "gpu-based implementations[43] of this approach won many pattern recognition contests, including the ijcnn 2011 traffic sign recognition competition,[40] the isbi 2012 segmentation of neuronal structures in em stacks challenge,[41] the imagenet competition[44] and others.\n",
      "deep, highly nonlinear neural architectures similar to the neocognitron[45] and the \"standard architecture of vision\",[46] inspired by simple and complex cells, were pre-trained by unsupervised methods by hinton.[47][28] a team from his lab won a 2012 contest sponsored by merck to design software to help find molecules that might identify new drugs.[48]\n",
      "as of 2011[update], the state of the art in deep learning feedforward networks alternated between convolutional layers and max-pooling layers,[43][49] topped by several fully or sparsely connected layers followed by a final classification layer. learning is usually done without unsupervised pre-training. in the convolutional layer, there are filters that are convolved with the input. each filter is equivalent to a weights vector that has to be trained.\n",
      "such supervised deep learning methods were the first to achieve human-competitive performance on certain tasks.[42]\n",
      "artificial neural networks were able to guarantee shift invariance to deal with small and large natural objects in large cluttered scenes, only when invariance extended beyond shift, to all ann-learned concepts, such as location, type (object class label), scale, lighting and others. this was realized in developmental networks (dns)[50] whose embodiments are where-what networks, wwn-1 (2008)[51] through wwn-7 (2013).[52]\n",

      "with inertia, the problems of getting stuck (in steep ravines and flat plateaus) are avoided. since, for example, the gradient of the error function becomes very small in flat plateaus, a plateau would immediately lead to a \"deceleration\" of the gradient descent. this deceleration is delayed by the addition of the inertia term so that a flat plateau can be escaped more quickly.\n",
      "two modes of learning are available: stochastic and batch. in stochastic learning, each input creates a weight adjustment. in batch learning weights are adjusted based on a batch of inputs, accumulating errors over the batch. stochastic learning introduces \"noise\" into the gradient descent process, using the local gradient calculated from one data point; this reduces the chance of the network getting stuck in local minima. however, batch learning typically yields a faster, more stable descent to a local minimum, since each update is performed in the direction of the average error of the batch. a common compromise choice is to use \"mini-batches\", meaning small batches and with samples in each batch selected stochastically from the entire data set.\n",
      "the group method of data handling (gmdh)[97] features fully automatic structural and parametric model optimization. the node activation functions are kolmogorov-gabor polynomials that permit additions and multiplications. it used a deep feedforward multilayer perceptron with eight layers.[98] it is a supervised learning network that grows layer by layer, where each layer is trained by regression analysis. useless items are detected using a validation set, and pruned through regularization. the size and depth of the resulting network depends on the task.[99]\n",
      "a convolutional neural network (cnn) is a class of deep, feed-forward networks, composed of one or more convolutional layers with fully connected layers (matching those in typical artificial neural networks) on top. it uses tied weights and pooling layers. in particular, max-pooling[20] is often structured via fukushima's convolutional architecture.[100] this architecture allows cnns to take advantage of the 2d structure of input data.\n",
      "cnns are suitable for processing visual and other two-dimensional data.[101][102] they have shown superior results in both image and speech applications. they can be trained with standard backpropagation. cnns are easier to train than other regular, deep, feed-forward neural networks and have many fewer parameters to estimate.[103] examples of applications in computer vision include deepdream[104] and robot navigation.[105]\n",
      "a recent development has been that of capsule neural network (capsnet), the idea behind which is to add structures called capsules to a cnn and to reuse output from several of those capsules to form more stable (with respect to various perturbations) representations for higher order capsules.[106]\n",
      "long short-term memory (lstm) networks are rnns that avoid the vanishing gradient problem.[107] lstm is normally augmented by recurrent gates called forget gates.[108] lstm networks prevent backpropagated errors from vanishing or exploding.[23] instead errors can flow backwards through unlimited numbers of virtual layers in space-unfolded lstm. that is, lstm can learn \"very deep learning\" tasks[12] that require memories of events that happened thousands or even millions of discrete time steps ago. problem-specific lstm-like topologies can be evolved.[109] lstm can handle long delays and signals that have a mix of low and high frequency components.\n",
      "stacks of lstm rnns[110] trained by connectionist temporal classification (ctc)[111] can find an rnn weight matrix that maximizes the probability of the label sequences in a training set, given the corresponding input sequences. ctc achieves both alignment and recognition.\n",
      "in 2003, lstm started to become competitive with traditional speech recognizers.[112] in 2007, the combination with ctc achieved first good results on speech data.[113] in 2009, a ctc-trained lstm was the first rnn to win pattern recognition contests, when it won several competitions in connected handwriting recognition.[12][38] in 2014, baidu used ctc-trained rnns to break the switchboard hub5'00 speech recognition benchmark, without traditional speech processing methods.[114] lstm also improved large-vocabulary speech recognition,[115][116] text-to-speech synthesis,[117] for google android,[57][118] and photo-real talking heads.[119] in 2015, google's speech recognition experienced a 49% improvement through ctc-trained lstm.[120]\n",
      "lstm became popular in natural language processing. unlike previous models based on hmms and similar concepts, lstm can learn to recognise context-sensitive languages.[121] lstm improved machine translation,[122][123] language modeling[124] and multilingual language processing.[125] lstm combined with cnns improved automatic image captioning.[126]\n",

      "a deep belief network (dbn) is a probabilistic, generative model made up of multiple layers of hidden units. it can be considered a composition of simple learning modules that make up each layer.[129]\n",
      "a dbn can be used to generatively pre-train a dnn by using the learned dbn weights as the initial dnn weights. backpropagation or other discriminative algorithms can then tune these weights. this is particularly helpful when training data are limited, because poorly initialized weights can significantly hinder model performance. these pre-trained weights are in a region of the weight space that is closer to the optimal weights than were they randomly chosen. this allows for both improved modeling and faster convergence of the fine-tuning phase.[130]\n",
      "large memory storage and retrieval neural networks (lamstar)[131][132] are fast deep learning neural networks of many layers that can use many filters simultaneously. these filters may be nonlinear, stochastic, logic, non-stationary, or even non-analytical. they are biologically motivated and learn continuously.\n",
      "a lamstar neural network may serve as a dynamic neural network in spatial or time domains or both. its speed is provided by hebbian link-weights[133] that integrate the various and usually different filters (preprocessing functions) into its many layers and to dynamically rank the significance of the various layers and functions relative to a given learning task. this grossly imitates biological learning which integrates various preprocessors (cochlea, retina, etc.) and cortexes (auditory, visual, etc.) and their various regions. its deep learning capability is further enhanced by using inhibition, correlation and its ability to cope with incomplete data, or \"lost\" neurons or layers even amidst a task. it is fully transparent due to its link weights. the link-weights allow dynamic determination of innovation and redundancy, and facilitate the ranking of layers, of filters or of individual neurons relative to a task.\n",
      "lamstar has been applied to many domains, including medical[134][135][136] and financial predictions,[137] adaptive filtering of noisy speech in unknown noise,[138] still-image recognition,[139] video image recognition,[140] software security[141] and adaptive control of non-linear systems.[142] lamstar had a much faster learning speed and somewhat lower error rate than a cnn based on relu-function filters and max pooling, in 20 comparative studies.[143]\n",
      "these applications demonstrate delving into aspects of the data that are hidden from shallow learning networks and the human senses, such as in the cases of predicting onset of sleep apnea events,[135] of an electrocardiogram of a fetus as recorded from skin-surface electrodes placed on the mother's abdomen early in pregnancy,[136] of financial prediction[131] or in blind filtering of noisy speech.[138]\n",
      "lamstar was proposed in 1996 (a u.s. patent 5,920,852 a) and was further developed graupe and kordylewski from 1997–2002.[144][145][146] a modified version, known as lamstar 2, was developed by schneider and graupe in 2008.[147][148]\n",

      "a more straightforward way to use kernel machines for deep learning was developed for spoken language understanding.[207] the main idea is to use a kernel machine to approximate a shallow neural net with an infinite number of hidden units, then use stacking to splice the output of the kernel machine and the raw input in building the next, higher level of the kernel machine. the number of levels in the deep convex network is a hyper-parameter of the overall system, to be determined by cross validation.\n",
      "neural architecture search (nas) uses machine learning to automate the design of artificial neural networks. various approaches to nas have designed networks that compare well with hand-designed systems. the basic search algorithm is to propose a candidate model, evaluate it against a dataset and use the results as feedback to teach the nas network.[208]\n",
      "using artificial neural networks requires an understanding of their characteristics.\n",
      "ann capabilities fall within the following broad categories:[citation needed]\n",
      "because of their ability to reproduce and model nonlinear processes, artificial neural networks have found many applications in a wide range of disciplines.\n",
      "application areas include system identification and control (vehicle control, trajectory prediction,[209] process control, natural resource management), quantum chemistry,[210] general game playing,[211] pattern recognition (radar systems, face identification, signal classification,[212] 3d reconstruction,[213] object recognition and more), sequence recognition (gesture, speech, handwritten and printed text recognition), medical diagnosis, finance[214] (e.g. automated trading systems), data mining, visualization, machine translation, social network filtering[215] and e-mail spam filtering.\n",
      "artificial neural networks have been used to diagnose cancers, including lung cancer,[216] prostate cancer, colorectal cancer[217] and to distinguish highly invasive cancer cell lines from less invasive lines using only cell shape information.[218][219]\n",
      "artificial neural networks have been used to accelerate reliability analysis of infrastructures subject to natural disasters[220][221] and to predict foundation settlements.[222]\n",
      "artificial neural networks have also been used for building black-box models in geoscience: hydrology,[223][224] ocean modelling and coastal engineering,[225][226] and geomorphology.[227]\n",
      "artificial neural networks have been employed with some success also in cybersecurity, with the objective to discriminate between legitimate activities and malicious ones. for example, machine learning has been used for classifying android malware,[228] for identifying domains belonging to threat actors[229] and for detecting urls posing a security risk.[230] research is being carried out also on ann systems designed for penetration testing,[231] for detecting botnets,[232] credit cards frauds,[233] network intrusions and, more in general, potentially infected machines.\n",
      "many types of models are used, defined at different levels of abstraction and modeling different aspects of neural systems. they range from models of the short-term behavior of individual neurons,[234] models of how the dynamics of neural circuitry arise from interactions between individual neurons and finally to models of how behavior can arise from abstract neural modules that represent complete subsystems. these include models of the long-term, and short-term plasticity, of neural systems and their relations to learning and memory from the individual neuron to the system level.\n",
      "the multilayer perceptron is a universal function approximator, as proven by the universal approximation theorem. however, the proof is not constructive regarding the number of neurons required, the network topology, the weights and the learning parameters.\n",
      "a specific recurrent architecture with rational valued weights (as opposed to full precision real number-valued weights) has the full power of a universal turing machine,[235] using a finite number of neurons and standard linear connections. further, the use of irrational values for weights results in a machine with super-turing power.[236]\n",
      "models' \"capacity\" property roughly corresponds to their ability to model any given function. it is related to the amount of information that can be stored in the network and to the notion of complexity.[citation needed]\n",
      "models may not consistently converge on a single solution, firstly because many local minima may exist, depending on the cost function and the model. secondly, the optimization method used might not guarantee to converge when it begins far from any local minimum. thirdly, for sufficiently large data or parameters, some methods become impractical. however, for cmac neural network, a recursive least squares algorithm was introduced to train it, and this algorithm can be guaranteed to converge in one step.[93]\n",
      "applications whose goal is to create a system that generalizes well to unseen examples, face the possibility of over-training. this arises in convoluted or over-specified systems when the capacity of the network significantly exceeds the needed free parameters. two approaches address over-training. the first is to use cross-validation and similar techniques to check for the presence of over-training and optimally select hyperparameters to minimize the generalization error. the second is to use some form of regularization. this concept emerges in a probabilistic (bayesian) framework, where regularization can be performed by selecting a larger prior probability over simpler models; but also in statistical learning theory, where the goal is to minimize over two quantities: the 'empirical risk' and the 'structural risk', which roughly corresponds to the error over the training set and the predicted error in unseen data due to overfitting.\n",
      "supervised neural networks that use a mean squared error (mse) cost function can use formal statistical methods to determine the confidence of the trained model. the mse on a validation set can be used as an estimate for variance. this value can then be used to calculate the confidence interval of the output of the network, assuming a normal distribution. a confidence analysis made this way is statistically valid as long as the output probability distribution stays the same and the network is not modified.\n",
      "by assigning a softmax activation function, a generalization of the logistic function, on the output layer of the neural network (or a softmax component in a component-based neural network) for categorical target variables, the outputs can be interpreted as posterior probabilities. this is very useful in classification as it gives a certainty measure on classifications.\n",
      "the softmax activation function is:\n",
      "\n",
      "a common criticism of neural networks, particularly in robotics, is that they require too much training for real-world operation.[citation needed] potential solutions include randomly shuffling training examples, by using a numerical optimization algorithm that does not take too large steps when changing the network connections following an example and by grouping examples in so-called mini-batches. improving the training efficiency and convergence capability has always been an ongoing research area for neural network. for example, by introducing a recursive least squares algorithm for cmac neural network, the training process only takes one step to converge.[93]\n",
      "a fundamental objection is that they do not reflect how real neurons function. back propagation is a critical part of most artificial neural networks, although no such mechanism exists in biological neural networks.[237] how information is coded by real neurons is not known. sensor neurons fire action potentials more frequently with sensor activation and muscle cells pull more strongly when their associated motor neurons receive action potentials more frequently.[238] other than the case of relaying information from a sensor neuron to a motor neuron, almost nothing of the principles of how information is handled by biological neural networks is known. this is a subject of active research in neural coding.\n",
      "the motivation behind artificial neural networks is not necessarily to strictly replicate neural function, but to use biological neural networks as an inspiration. a central claim of artificial neural networks is therefore that it embodies some new and powerful general principle for processing information. unfortunately, these general principles are ill-defined. it is often claimed that they are emergent from the network itself. this allows simple statistical association (the basic function of artificial neural networks) to be described as learning or recognition. alexander dewdney commented that, as a result, artificial neural networks have a \"something-for-nothing quality, one that imparts a peculiar aura of laziness and a distinct lack of curiosity about just how good these computing systems are. no human hand (or mind) intervenes; solutions are found as if by magic; and no one, it seems, has learned anything\".[239]\n",
      "biological brains use both shallow and deep circuits as reported by brain anatomy,[240] displaying a wide variety of invariance. weng[241] argued that the brain self-wires largely according to signal statistics and therefore, a serial cascade cannot catch all major statistical dependencies.\n",
      "large and effective neural networks require considerable computing resources.[242] while the brain has hardware tailored to the task of processing signals through a graph of neurons, simulating even a simplified neuron on von neumann architecture may compel a neural network designer to fill many millions of database rows for its connections –  which can consume vast amounts of memory and storage. furthermore, the designer often needs to transmit signals through many of these connections and their associated neurons –  which must often be matched with enormous cpu processing power and time.\n",
      "schmidhuber notes that the resurgence of neural networks in the twenty-first century is largely attributable to advances in hardware: from 1991 to 2015, computing power, especially as delivered by gpgpus (on gpus), has increased around a million-fold, making the standard backpropagation algorithm feasible for training networks that are several layers deeper than before.[243] the use of accelerators such as fpgas and gpus can reduce training times from months to days.[244][242]\n",
      "neuromorphic engineering addresses the hardware difficulty directly, by constructing non-von-neumann chips to directly implement neural networks in circuitry. another chip optimized for neural network processing is called a tensor processing unit, or tpu.[245]\n",
      "arguments against dewdney's position are that neural networks have been successfully used to solve many complex and diverse tasks, ranging from autonomously flying aircraft[246] to detecting credit card fraud to mastering the game of go.\n",
      "technology writer roger bridgman commented:\n",
      "although it is true that analyzing what has been learned by an artificial neural network is difficult, it is much easier to do so than to analyze what has been learned by a biological neural network. furthermore, researchers involved in exploring learning algorithms for neural networks are gradually uncovering general principles that allow a learning machine to be successful. for example, local vs non-local learning and shallow vs deep architecture.[248]\n",
      "advocates of hybrid models (combining neural networks and symbolic approaches), claim that such a mixture can better capture the mechanisms of the human mind.[249][250]\n",
      "artificial neural networks have many variations. the simplest, static types have one or more static components, including number of units, number of layers, unit weights and topology. dynamic types allow one or more of these to change during the learning process. the latter are much more complicated, but can shorten learning periods and produce better results. some types allow/require learning to be \"supervised\" by the operator, while others operate independently. some types operate purely in hardware, while others are purely software and run on general purpose computers.\n",

      "opening first-result\n",
      "case-based reasoning (cbr), broadly construed, is the process of solving new problems based on the solutions of similar past problems. an auto mechanic who fixes an engine by recalling another car that exhibited similar symptoms is using case-based reasoning.  a lawyer who advocates a particular outcome in a trial based on legal precedents or a judge who creates case law is using case-based reasoning.  so, too, an engineer copying working elements of nature (practicing biomimicry), is treating nature as a database of solutions to problems. case-based reasoning is a prominent type of analogy solution making.\n",
      "it has been argued that case-based reasoning is not only a powerful method for computer reasoning, but also a pervasive behavior in everyday human problem solving;  or, more radically, that all reasoning is based on past cases personally experienced. this view is related to prototype theory, which is most deeply explored in cognitive science.\n",
