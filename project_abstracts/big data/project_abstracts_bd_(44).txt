The research of policy big data retrieval and analysis based on elastic search&&&&&As big data technologies develop, data retrieval and analysis has become an important research topic recently. This paper designs and implements a data retrieval and analysis platform based on elastic search. On the one hand, the system can store and search policy big data efficiently and reliably, and index data with real-time performance. On the other hand, policy big data has its own characteristics, for example, policy data have the properties of time, region, category, source, hot words, so this paper proposes the multidimensional analysis methods. In detail, by analysing from the aspects of the time, region, category, and keywords co-occurrence, this paper defines the characteristics of policy data, and displays them in a visual way.&&&&&Urban areas,Indexes,Data mining,Big Data,Local government,Data models$$$$$Big Data,data analysis,information retrieval$$$$$policy big data retrieval,elastic search,big data technologies,multidimensional analysis methods$$$$$elastic search,multidimensional analysis,policy big data,visualization
