ORANGE: Spatial big data analysis platform&&&&&Information which is related to the geographic area is being produced continuously. However, there is currently no technique that can handle large spatial data. For this reason, we developed a spatial big data platform, ORANGE, based on the Apache Hadoop. ORANGE can load the vector and raster data based on HDFS and manages metadata and creates index data using the Apache HIVE. These improvements made the platform faster process of large scale spatial data. In case of comparing the nine-Intersection Model.&&&&&Spatial databases,Big data,Libraries,Metadata,Load modeling,Spatial indexes,Conferences$$$$$Big Data,data analysis,meta data,visual databases$$$$$ORANGE,spatial big data analysis platform,Apache Hadoop,HDFS,meta data,nine-intersection model$$$$$Spatial Big Data,Spatial Hadoop,Spatial Analysis,Visualization
