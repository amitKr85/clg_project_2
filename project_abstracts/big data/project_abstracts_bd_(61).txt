Gateway-based access interface management in big data platform&&&&&Nowadays, there has been a massive data explosion coming from various devices sensors, social networks and IoT services. Due to big data analytics platforms, users can store, organize, and process these large sets of data to solve different issues in different domains. However, the current big data platforms still have many drawbacks. Among the limitations, managing access interfaces, an important process of analytic service development, needs to be improved significantly. The main reason is that the emergence of too many systems recently has been making the process become more and more complicated and costly. Therefore, we propose here a system related to the field of big data management, in particular to interface management to allow end-users to use easily their desired functions including metadata and data accessing. It also helps platform managers to extend and modify effortlessly the access interfaces. A case study on log analytic service is conducted to verify the validation and practice use of our system.&&&&&Big Data,Logic gates,Servers,Authentication,Metadata,Interface management,Authorization$$$$$authorisation,Big Data,data analysis,Internet of Things,internetworking,meta data$$$$$Big Data platform,gateway-based access interface management,IoT services,social networks,metadata,data accessing,log analytic service$$$$$Analytic,Big data,Gateway,Interface Management,Metadata
