Big data analytic empowered grid applications â€” Is PMU a big data issue?&&&&&With the proliferation of digital measurement devices, such as smart meter on the distribution systems and phasor measurement units on the transmission systems, power companies find themselves inundated with increasingly growing data and long for efficient tools and analytical techniques to identify, digest and utilize critical information to improve the efficiency and reliability of grid operations. Many power researchers believe that the PMU related power system analytics falls under the category of Big Data Science and are keen to apply typical technologies for solution, including machine learning, data mining, cloud based computation and so on. This paper explores the reason behind such presumption, challenges to deal with PMU data, and trends of analytical techniques.&&&&&Phasor measurement units,Big data,Power system stability,Monitoring,Data visualization,Analytical models,Software$$$$$Big Data,cloud computing,data mining,learning (artificial intelligence),phasor measurement,power distribution reliability,power engineering computing,power grids,smart meters,transmission networks$$$$$analytic empowered grid application,digital measurement devices,smart meter,distribution systems,phasor measurement units,PMU data,transmission systems,power companies,grid operations,power system analytics,Big Data science,machine learning,data mining,cloud based computation$$$$$Synchrophasor,measurements,grid operation,big data,power system analysis
