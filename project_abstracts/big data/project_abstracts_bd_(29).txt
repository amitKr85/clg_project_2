Big data machine learning and graph analytics: Current state and future challenges&&&&&Big data machine learning and graph analytics have been widely used in industry, academia and government. Continuous advance in this area is critical to business success, scientific discovery, as well as cybersecurity. In this paper, we present some current projects and propose that next-generation computing systems for big data machine learning and graph analytics need innovative designs in both hardware and software that provide a good match between big data algorithms and the underlying computing and storage resources.&&&&&Big data,Computer architecture,Conferences,Machine learning algorithms,Graphics processing units,Hardware,Nonvolatile memory$$$$$Big Data,graph theory,learning (artificial intelligence)$$$$$Big Data machine learning,graph analytics,business success,scientific discovery,cybersecurity,next-generation computing systems,hardware innovative designs,software innovative designs,Big Data algorithms,computing resources,storage resources$$$$$Big Data,Lambda Architecture,Hardware and Software Co-Design,Graphics Processing Unit,Non-Volatile Memory,Solid-State Drive
