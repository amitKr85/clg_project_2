Big Data Analytics Architecture for Internet-of-Vehicles Based on the Spark&&&&&Internet-of-Vehicles (IoV) technology is the development trend of the intelligent traffic management system, it is also an effective means to ease traffic and improve traffic efficiency. This article used big data analysis technology to build a big data analysis platform of intelligent transportation, the platform is decomposed into infrastructure layer, data analysis layer and application layer; All vehicle information are acquired by several in-vehicle sensors on ECUs or roadside, and the acquired sensor data and received information are for information fusion, processing, trajectory prediction and risk assessment. The platform can solve the problem of storage, analysis and multi terminal distribution of mass data, provide traffic information services to traffic management departments and the public, it is a useful attempt to apply advanced information technology to the transportation industry.&&&&&Conferences,Transportation,Big Data,Smart cities$$$$$Big Data,data analysis,Internet of Things,sensor fusion,traffic information systems,transportation$$$$$data analysis layer,vehicle information,Spark,intelligent transportation,big data analysis technology,traffic efficiency,intelligent traffic management system,internet-of-Vehicles technology,big data analytics architecture,traffic management departments,traffic information services,risk assessment,information fusion,acquired sensor data$$$$$Sensors,Big-data,Internet-of-Vehicles,Fusion
