Utilizing Big Data Analysis for Diseases Prevention and Control During Hajj&&&&&This is a conceptual paper that aims to make use of annually accumulated big data collected from more than two million pilgrims gathered in one place at one time in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia during the Hajj. This paper proposes an approach to Hajj Health Control (HHC) to handle big data issues and avoid data loss, which will lead to improved healthcare and assist with disease prevention systems during the Hajj period. The implementation of big data methods of management and analysis using Structured Query Language (SQL) is suggested to assist with the epidemiological surveillance of diseases and plans for prevention and control, as well as to help with future health planning and decision making.&&&&&Big data,Ports (Computers),Surveillance,Hospitals$$$$$Big Data,data analysis,diseases,epidemics,health care,SQL$$$$$big data analysis,diseases prevention,Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,Hajj health control,data loss,healthcare improvement,disease prevention system assistance,big data management methods,structured query language,SQL,epidemiological disease surveillance$$$$$Hajj,big data model,health strea,International Classification of Disease,Saudi Arabia
