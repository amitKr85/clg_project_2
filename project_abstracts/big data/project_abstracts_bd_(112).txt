Research on reliability evaluation of big data system&&&&&The application of big data system is now more pervasive. The reliability of the large data system is crucial to both the academic and the industry. However, to date there are few studies on the reliability of the big data system, and lack of evaluation model. This paper uses the fault tree to model the reliability of the big data system on the cloud. The type of faults is summarized and the cause of fault is analyzed by experiments. The fault tree analysis (FTA) is used to evaluate the reliability of the big data system, which can provide reference for the fault processing and quality assurance of big data system.&&&&&Big Data,Fault trees,Software,Software reliability,Data models,Hardware$$$$$Big Data,cloud computing,fault trees,quality assurance$$$$$big data system,reliability evaluation,large data system reliability,evaluation model,fault tree analysis,FTA,fault processing,quality assurance$$$$$big data system,reliability,fault tree,evaluation
