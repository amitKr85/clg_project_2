Saving costs with a big data strategy framework&&&&&Disruptive innovations such as Big Data offer enormous benefits to organizations however they usually come with a cost. Decision makers instinctively seek to adopt such innovative technologies for competitive advantage, however, they also explore ways in reducing implementation costs to a reasonable level. This research was focused on developing and empirically testing a Big Data Strategy framework that helps organizations in aligning their business strategy with the Big Data project in order to identify the potential value before embarking on a full Big Data implementation. The SAVI-BIGD framework was tested in two different organizations and findings reveals that the framework can help organizations identify the potential value of the Big Data project and also to save costs. This paper reports on a second case study testing and suggests how any organization taking ownership and championing the implementation of this Big Data strategy framework could save cost and generate their Strategic Big Data Goals.&&&&&Big Data,Organizations,Satellite broadcasting,Interviews,Data science,Standards organizations$$$$$Big Data,business data processing,innovation management,organisational aspects,strategic planning$$$$$big data strategy framework,organizations,Big Data project,Big Data implementation,Strategic Big Data Goals,implementation cost reduction,cost saving,decision makers,innovative technologies,business strategy,SAVI-BIGD framework,case study testing$$$$$Big Data,Strategy,Methodology,Method,Framework,Business Strategy,Digital Strategy,IS Alignment,Data Science
