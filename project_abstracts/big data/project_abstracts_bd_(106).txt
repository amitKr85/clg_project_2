Hyperbolic tangent activation function on FIMT-DD algorithm analysis for airline big data&&&&&In recent years, big data has become hot and challenging issue. The use of big data term in many areas provided positive impact. In traffic area included road traffic, railway traffic, and airline traffic, there is huge information can be obtained. The needed of big data analytics to process the data quickly and give an accurate prediction about it, became essential. The FIMT-DD with hyperbolic tangent (tanh) algorithm is proposed to predict the airline big data. The simulation time of FIMT-DD-tanh is almost the same with original FIMT-DD. Based on this analysis and evaluation, in data stream mining evaluation, FIMT-DD-tanh could be able to decrease the error value in airline big dataset.&&&&&Big Data,data analysis,data mining,traffic engineering computing$$$$$road traffic,railway traffic,airline traffic,big data analytics,hyperbolic tangent algorithm,airline big data,FIMT-DD-tanh,original FIMT-DD,data stream mining evaluation,airline big dataset,hyperbolic tangent activation function,FIMT-DD algorithm analysis,big data term,traffic area$$$$$Hyperbolic Tangent,Activation Function,FIMT-DD,Airline data,Big Data
