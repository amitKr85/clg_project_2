Visualization of a Scale Free Network in a Smartphone-Based Multimedia Big Data Environment&&&&&Smartphones equipped with varieties of sensors enable them in participatory and opportunistic crowd-sourced sensing. The built-in as well as external sensors paired with modern smartphones provide an ideal multimedia big data source, where a very large crowd can share audio, video, text, SMS, location, etc. In this paper, we will illustrate our proposed big data framework that has been storing multimedia data from a very large crowd since September 2014. Our framework uses Scale Free Network (SFN) to represent the dynamics of large crowd and produces visualization metrics by running spatio-temporal queries over the proposed multimedia big data framework.&&&&&Multimedia communication,Big data,Data visualization,Sensors,Streaming media,Computer architecture,Smart phones$$$$$Big Data,data visualisation,multimedia computing,query processing,smart phones$$$$$scale free network visualization,smartphone- based multimedia big data environment,opportunistic crowd-sourced sensing,external sensors,multimedia big data source,SMS,SFN,visualization metrics,spatio-temporal queries$$$$$Crowd sourcing,multimedia,big data,spatio-temporal queries
