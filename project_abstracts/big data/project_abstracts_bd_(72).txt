Knowledge Discovery from Big Data for Intrusion Detection Using LDA&&&&&This paper explores a hybrid approach of intrusion detection through knowledge discovery from big data using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). We identify the "hidden" patterns of operations conducted by both normal users and malicious users from a large volume of network/systems logs, by mapping this problem to the topic modeling problem and leveraging the well established LDA models and learning algorithms. This new approach potentially completes the strength of signature-based and anomaly-based methods.&&&&&Intrusion detection,Monitoring,Big data,Vocabulary,Knowledge discovery,Data models$$$$$Big Data,data mining,learning (artificial intelligence),security of data$$$$$knowledge discovery,Big Data,intrusion detection,LDA,latent Dirichlet allocation,network logs,topic modeling problem,LDA models,learning algorithms,anomaly-based methods,signature-based methods,system logs$$$$$intrusion detection,big data,data mining,LDA
