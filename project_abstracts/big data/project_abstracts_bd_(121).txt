Challenges of Software Testing for Astronomical Big Data&&&&&Astronomy has been one of the first areas of science to embrace and learn from big data. The amount of data we have on our universe is doubling every year thanks to big telescopes and better light detectors. Most leading research is based on data from a handful of very expensive telescopes. Undoubtedly, the data quality is the key basis for the leading scientific findings. It is imperative that software testers understand that big data is about far more than simply data volume. This paper will analyze characteristics, types, methods, strategies, problems, challenges and propose some possible solutions of software testing for astronomical big data.&&&&&Big Data,Software testing,Software,Astronomy,Data analysis,Distributed databases$$$$$astronomy computing,Big Data,program testing$$$$$software testing,astronomical big data,data quality,scientific findings,software testers$$$$$software testing; big data; astronomical software
