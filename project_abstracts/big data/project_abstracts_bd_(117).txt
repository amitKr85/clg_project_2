A Big Data Framework for Electric Power Data Quality Assessment&&&&&Since a low-quality data may influence the effectiveness and reliability of applications, data quality is required to be guaranteed. Data quality assessment is considered as the foundation of the promotion of data quality, so it is essential to access the data quality before any other data related activities. In the electric power industry, more and more electric power data is continuously accumulated, and many electric power applications have been developed based on these data. In China, the power grid has many special characteristic, traditional big data assessment frameworks cannot be directly applied. Therefore, a big data framework for electric power data quality assessment is proposed. Based on big data techniques, the framework can accumulate both the real-time data and the history data, provide an integrated computation environment for electric power big data assessment, and support the storage of different types of data.&&&&&Big Data,Data integrity,Power grids,History,Real-time systems,Sensors$$$$$Big Data,data analysis,electricity supply industry,power engineering computing,power grids$$$$$big data framework,electric power data quality assessment,low-quality data,data related activities,electric power industry,electric power applications,special characteristic data assessment frameworks,big data techniques,real-time data,history data,electric power big data assessment,power grid$$$$$data quality,electric power data,data quality assessment,big data,framework
