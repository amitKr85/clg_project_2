Shade: A differentially-private wrapper for enterprise big data&&&&&Enterprises usually provide strong controls to prevent cyberattacks and inadvertent leakage of data to external entities. However, in the case where employees and data scientists have legitimate access to analyze and derive insights from the data, there are insufficient controls and employees are usually permitted access to all information about the customers of the enterprise including sensitive and private information. Though it is important to be able to identify useful patterns of one's customers for better customization and service, customers' privacy must not be sacrificed to do so. We propose an alternative - a framework that will allow privacy preserving data analytics over big data. In this paper, we present an efficient and scalable framework for Apache Spark, a cluster computing framework, that provides strong privacy guarantees for users even in the presence of an informed adversary, while still providing high utility for analysts. The framework, titled Shade, includes two mechanisms - SparkLAP, which provides Laplacian perturbation based on a user's query and SparkSAM, which uses the contents of the database itself in order to calculate the perturbation. We show that the performance of Shade is substantially better than earlier differential privacy systems without loss of accuracy, particularly when run on datasets small enough to fit in memory, and find that SparkSAM can even exceed performance of an identical nonprivate Spark query.&&&&&Privacy,Data privacy,Sparks,Sensitivity,Databases,Big Data,Laplace equations$$$$$Big Data,business data processing,cluster computing,data analysis,data privacy,database management systems,query processing$$$$$differentially-private wrapper,enterprise big data,strong controls,cyberattacks,external entities,employees,legitimate access,sensitive information,private information,customization,service,efficient framework,scalable framework,Apache Spark,cluster computing framework,strong privacy guarantees,informed adversary,user,customer privacy,pattern identification,privacy preserving data analytics,Shade,data inadvertent leakage,data scientists,big data,SparkLAP,Laplacian perturbation,user query,SparkSAM,database,differential privacy systems,identical nonprivate Spark query$$$$$enterprise big data,differential privacy,big data analytics
