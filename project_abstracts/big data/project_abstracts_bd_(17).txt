KDD meets Big Data&&&&&Cross-Industry Standard process model (CRISPDM) was developed in the late 90s by a consortium of industry participants to facilitate the end-to-end data mining process for Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD). While there have been efforts to better integrate with management and software development practices, there are no extension to handle the new activities involved in using big data technologies. Data Science Edge (DSE) is an enhanced process model to accommodate big data technologies and data science activities. In recognition of the changes, the author promotes the use of a new term, Knowledge Discovery in Data Science (KDDS) as a call for the community to develop a new industry standard data science process model.&&&&&Big data,Data science,Organizations,Data models,Standards organizations,Data mining,Capability maturity model$$$$$Big Data,data mining,software engineering$$$$$knowledge discovery in databases,KDD,knowledge discovery in data science,KDDS,data science edge,DSE,cross-industry standard process model,CRISPDM,data mining process,software development practices,management practices,big data technologies,industry standard data science process model$$$$$data science,big data,knowledge discovery,KDD,KDDM,KDDS,data mining,analytics,analytics lifecycle,data lifecycle
