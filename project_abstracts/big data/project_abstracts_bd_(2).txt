An exploratory study on big data processing: A case study from a biomedical informatics&&&&&Recent studies confirm that big data processing will be a leading trend in the next several years in the biomedical field. Technical advancements in the field of medicine and life science demand for high storage and processing power. This paper presents an exploratory study on big data processing from a biomedical informatics perspective. In an attempt to perform this task, two case studies are considered from medical imaging and bioinformatics specifically proteomics aspect. It has been identified that there is scope for the growing medical imaging data and proteomic data be efficiently stored and processed through the use of big data technology. This study will also benefit the researchers working on big data tools in conjunction with data mining tools.&&&&&Big data,Proteins,Bioinformatics,Diseases,Medical diagnostic imaging$$$$$Big Data,bioinformatics,biomedical imaging,data mining,medical computing,proteomics$$$$$Big data processing,biomedical informatics,biomedical field,medicine field,life science demand,medical imaging data,Big data tools,data mining tools$$$$$Big data,Big data processing,Bioinformatics,Medical imaging,Neurodegenerative diseases
