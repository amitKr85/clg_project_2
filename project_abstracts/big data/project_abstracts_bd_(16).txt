Towards the Design of a System and a Workflow Model for Medical Big Data Processing in the Hybrid Cloud&&&&&Globally, a big data analytics technology is being issued in various business areas including the medical field. Because the technologies demand a large number of resources, studies on a distributed cloud including a hybrid cloud technology are needed. However, there are limitations of performance and cost since the most of hospitals use the private cloud of low computing resource. Thus, a research on the hybrid cloud is required to resolve the limitations. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a system called BigPros for medical big data processing with the proposed workflow model in the hybrid cloud resolving above issues. Based on this study, the BigPros can provide an efficient data processing method for a medical big data analytics in the hybrid cloud environment.&&&&&Batch production systems,Big Data,Task analysis,Cloud computing,Data models,Ontologies$$$$$Big Data,cloud computing,data analysis,hospitals,medical administrative data processing$$$$$workflow model,medical big data processing,big data analytics technology,medical field,distributed cloud,hybrid cloud technology,private cloud,low computing resource,medical big data analytics,hybrid cloud environment,hospitals,BigPros$$$$$Big data Computing; Hybrid Cloud; Dynamic Workflow; Directed Acyclic Graph; MapReduce
