Research on the Application of Big Data in Academic Libraries&&&&&This paper proposes a big data application model system of academic library. From the perspective of big data collection and integration, big data analysis methods, knowledge services, and the shortage of resources, this paper analyzes the plight of library big data application and then constructs a library big data application model system based on large scale network analysis method. This library big data application model based on knowledge management theory and open source cloud computing platform based on large scale network analysis method can face the challenge of big data service in academic library and effectively promote the further development of big data service in academic library.&&&&&Conferences,Transportation,Big Data,Smart cities$$$$$academic libraries,Big Data,cloud computing,data analysis,knowledge management,public domain software$$$$$big data service,academic library,integration,scale network analysis method,big data analysis,knowledge management theory,open source cloud computing platform$$$$$Keywords - Knowledge Management,Cloud Computing,Application Mode,Big Data of Academic Library
