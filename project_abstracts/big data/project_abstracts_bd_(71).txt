A performance evaluation of Apache Kafka in support of big data streaming applications&&&&&Stream computing is becoming a more and more popular paradigm as it enables the real-time promise of data analytics. Apache Kafka is currently the most popular framework used to ingest the data streams into the processing platforms. However, how to tune Kafka and how much resources to allocate for it remains a challenge for most users, who now rely mainly on empirical approaches to determine the best parameter settings for their deployments. In this poster, we make a through evaluation of several configurations and performance metrics of Kafka in order to allow users avoid bottlenecks, reach its full potential and avoid bottlenecks and eventually leverage some good practice for efficient stream processing.&&&&&Throughput,Big Data,Real-time systems,Benchmark testing,Measurement,Internet of Things,Sparks$$$$$Big Data,data analysis,fault tolerant computing,resource allocation$$$$$stream processing,big data streaming applications,resource allocation,parameter settings,empirical approaches,processing platforms,data analytics,stream computing,Apache Kafka,performance evaluation,performance metrics$$$$$Stream computing,Apache Kafka,Big Data
