Comparative study of tools for big data analytics: An analytical study&&&&&Data sets grow rapidly in different forms due to digitalization. When the data or information sets which are too large and are complex in nature in which traditional data processing techniques are not able to deal with those complex data, then that data is called B ig data. Researchers, scientists, business organizations, government agencies, advertising agencies, medical researchers often come across more difficulty in dealing with data for any decision making. The data available for research has to be processed by using various techniques of data analytics which is called Big Data Analytics. These techniques helps in getting benefits in dealing with massive volume of either unstructured, structured or semi-structured data content that is fast changing nature, also not possible to process using conventional database techniques. This paper discusses the major utilization of big data analytics by comparing different tools available for big data validation. Furthermore, this paper discusses the case study conducted to overcome the big data challenges and needs.&&&&&Tools,Big Data,Data visualization,Data analysis,Data mining,Automation$$$$$Big Data,data analysis,decision making$$$$$data content,Big Data analytics,data processing techniques,Big Data validation,decision making$$$$$Big Data Analytics,Data Sets,Challenges,big data validation,unstructured data,multiple techniques,semi-structured data
