Research on Warship Communication Operation and Maintenance Management Based on Big Data&&&&&Big data as another revolution of information technology is happening and has a huge impact on many fields of the society. In the military communication field, massive and multi-source data with explosive growth of operational command, operation and maintenance, meteorological environment provides the information source for data analysis in "information war" era. In order to improve the operational command efficiency in actual combat and enable to real-time predict and analyze battlefield situation and network performance and fault needs the support of intelligent and automatic communication operation and maintenance. In this paper, on a basis of related technologies of big data, focusing on the requirement of big data in the warship communication operation and maintenance management, and proposing a management architecture of warship communication operation and maintenance management based on big data, and the advantages of big data in the application of warship communication operation and maintenance management system are analyzed. Finally several issues of big data hold in the application of warship communication operation and maintenance management are elaborated.&&&&&Big data,Maintenance engineering,Business,Real-time systems,Data analysis,Servers,Computer architecture$$$$$Big Data,data analysis,maintenance engineering,military vehicles,ships$$$$$warship communication operation,maintenance management,big data,information technology,military communication field,multisource data,meteorological environment,information source,data analysis,information war era,operational command efficiency$$$$$big data,warship communication,operation and maintenance management
