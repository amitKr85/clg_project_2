A multimedia big data retrieval framework to detect dyslexia among children&&&&&In this paper we present a tablet-based and big data-based multimedia environment, which uses text, audio, video, and gaze movement to detect a set of symptoms of having dyslexia among children of age both less than 10 and greater than 10. Multi-modal screening test modules have been developed, which gives indications of further dyslexia diagnosis. The multimedia framework is envisioned to accelerate and ease the process of testing dyslexia at the global level, and to identify and auto assess potential Dyslexic patterns and to accumulate huge collection of multimedia test data for in-depth dyslexia pattern analysis.&&&&&Multimedia communication,Streaming media,Medical services,Big Data,Writing,Servers,Media$$$$$Big Data,handicapped aids,medical disorders,multimedia computing,multimedia systems,neurophysiology$$$$$multimedia framework,multimedia test data,in-depth dyslexia pattern analysis,multimedia environment,gaze movement,multimodal screening test modules,dyslexia diagnosis,multimedia Big Data retrieval framework$$$$$Dyslexia,Gaze Tracking,Accessibility,Big Data
