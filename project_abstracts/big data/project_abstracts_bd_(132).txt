Advanced Query Answering Techniques over Big Mobile Data&&&&&Mobile environments are classical settings where big data arise, mostly raised up by emerging (mobile) environmentssuch as social networks, sensor networks, IoT infrastructures, and so forth. This phenomenon introduces a novel class of big data, the so-called big mobile data. Big mobile data demand for novel models, techniques and algorithms devoted to the annoying problem of effectively and efficiently querying large-scale, enormous, highly-heterogeneous amounts of data, which is now living a renewed season precisely due to the advent of the big data era. Indeed, classical approaches developed during decades of database research activities demand for novel adaptations and optimizations explicitly tailored to deal with the (many) V-requirements of big data management in mobile environments. In line with this emerging research trends, this panel will focus the attention on state-of-the-art proposals in the area of advanced query answering techniques over big mobile data, and will propose critical comments about pros and cons of actual research efforts along with future research directions to be considered in future years.&&&&&Mobile communication,Big data,Query processing,Context,Distributed databases,Proposals,Trajectory$$$$$Big Data,mobile computing,query processing$$$$$big mobile data,large-scale-enormous-highly-heterogeneous data query,database research activities,Big Data management,mobile environments,advanced-query answering techniques$$$$$Big Data,Big Mobile Data,Querying Big Mobile
