Semantic HMC for big data analysis&&&&&Analyzing Big Data can help corporations to improve their efficiency. In this work we present a new vision to derive Value from Big Data using a Semantic Hierarchical Multi-label Classification called Semantic HMC based in a non-supervised Ontology learning process. We also propose a Semantic HMC process, using scalable Machine-Learning techniques and Rule-based reasoning.&&&&&Big data,Semantics,Ontologies,Cognition,Data mining,Taxonomy,Vectors$$$$$Big Data,data analysis,inference mechanisms,knowledge based systems,learning (artificial intelligence),ontologies (artificial intelligence),pattern classification$$$$$semantic HMC,Big Data analysis,semantic hierarchical multilabel classification,nonsupervised ontology learning process,machine-learning techniques,rule-based reasoning$$$$$classification,multi-classify,Big-Data,ontology,semantic technologies,machine learning
