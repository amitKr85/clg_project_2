Near Real-Time Big-Data Processing for Data Driven Applications&&&&&This paper addresses the context data integration and processing problem for design of data driven application by introducing ASAPCS (Auto-scaling and Adjustment Platform for Cloud-based Systems) platform. Conceptual model, technical architecture and data integration process are described. The ASAPCS platform supports model-driven configuration, separation of context acquisition and application, utilization of various context processing algorithms and scalability. It is based on technologies that have proven to work well with big data and each part of it is horizontally scalable. ASAPCs integrates data from heterogeneous sources and aggregates raw context data and uses it to perform real-time adjustments in the data-driven application. Its application is illustrated with example of providing data store resilience.&&&&&Context modeling,Real-time systems,Cognition,Adaptation models,Sparks,Data integration,Data models$$$$$Big Data,cloud computing,data integration,ubiquitous computing$$$$$data store resilience,context data integration,conceptual model,technical architecture,ASAPCS platform,context acquisition,context processing algorithms,heterogeneous sources,Big-data processing,raw context data aggregation,autoscaling and adjustment platform for cloud-based systems,model-driven configuration$$$$$stream processing,big data,cloud computing,data-driven systems
