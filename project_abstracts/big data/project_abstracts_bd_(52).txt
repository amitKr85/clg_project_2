The application of big data using MongoDB: Case study with SCeLE Fasilkom UI forum data&&&&&Big Data is a condition in which data size in a database is very large so it is difficult to be managed. An e-Learning application, like SCeLE Fasilkom UI (scele.cs.ui.ac.id), also has a very large data. SCeLE has hundreds of forum data, and each forum has at least 4000 threads of discussion. In addition, one thread can have at least dozens or hundreds posts. Therefore, it may further experience data growth problem, which will be difficult to be handled by RDBMS, such as MySQL that is currently used. In order to solve this problem, a research been conducted to apply Big Data in SCeLE Fasilkom UI, which implementation is aimed to increase SCeLE's data management performance. The implementation of Big Data in the research used MongoDB as the system's DBMS. The research result showed that MongoDB obtain better results than MySQL in SCeLE Fasilkom UI forum data case in terms of speed.&&&&&Big data,Data models,Scholarships,Structured Query Language,Analytical models,Relational databases$$$$$Big Data,computer aided instruction,document handling,relational databases,SQL$$$$$big data,MongoDB,SCeLE Fasilkom UI forum data,e-Learning application,data growth problem,RDBMS,MySQL$$$$$Big Data,Database,SCeLE,MySQL,MongoDB,DBMS
