A Study on Discovery Method of Hot Topics Based on Smart Campus Big Data Platform&&&&&To study and pose an modified discovery method for campus hot topics. The method is to extract word segmentation and keywords from the campus news collected on information big data platform through ICTCLAS word segmentation system, construct the text knowledge representation model based on vector space modal and finally add up the word frequency of headlines to determine k initial clustering centers and improve K-Means algorithm so as to obtain the campus hot topics.&&&&&Transportation,Big Data,Smart cities$$$$$Big Data,data mining,educational computing,knowledge representation,pattern clustering,text analysis$$$$$smart campus big data platform,modified discovery method,campus news,information big data platform,ICTCLAS word segmentation system,text knowledge representation model,campus hot topics discovery,headline word frequency,clustering centers,K-means algorithm$$$$$Smart Campus,Big Data,K-Means algorithm,Discovery Method of Hot Topics
