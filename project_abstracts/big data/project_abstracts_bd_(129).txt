Genetic Algorithm Based Data-Aware Group Scheduling for Big Data Clouds&&&&&Cloud computing is a promising cost efficient service oriented computing platform in the fields of science, engineering, business and social networking for delivering the resources on demand. Big Data Clouds is a new generation data analytics platform using Cloud computing as a back end technologies, for information mining, knowledge discovery and decision making based on statistical and empirical tools. MapReduce scheduling models for Big Data computing operate in the cluster mode, where the data nodes are pre-configured with the computing facility for processing. These MapReduce models are based on compute push model-pushing the logic to the data node for analysis, which is primarily for minimizing or eliminating data migration overheads between computing resources and data nodes. Such models, however, substantially perform well in the cluster setups, but are infelicitous for the platforms having the decoupled data storage and computing resources. In this paper, we propose a Genetic Algorithm based scheduler for such Big Data Cloud where decoupled computational and data services are offered as services. The approach is based on evolutionary methods focussed on data dependencies, computational resources and effective utilization of bandwidth thus achieving higher throughputs.&&&&&Biological cells,Genetic algorithms,Big data,Processor scheduling,Scheduling,Data models,Cloud computing$$$$$Big Data,cloud computing,data analysis,data mining,decision making,genetic algorithms,parallel processing,pattern clustering,processor scheduling,service-oriented architecture,statistical analysis$$$$$genetic algorithm based data aware group scheduling,Big data cloud computing,cost efficient service oriented computing,data analytics,information mining,knowledge discovery,decision making,statistical tool,empirical tool,MapReduce scheduling model,cluster mode,data node preconfiguration,push model-pushing,decoupled computational service,data service,evolutionary method,data dependency,computational resource,effective bandwidth utilisation,throughput$$$$$Big Data,Cloud computing,Data Intensive Scheduling,Genetic algorithms,Big Data Clouds
