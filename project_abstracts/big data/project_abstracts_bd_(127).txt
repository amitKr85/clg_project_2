Storing and manipulating environmental big data with JASMIN&&&&&JASMIN is a super-data-cluster designed to provide a high-performance high-volume data analysis environment for the UK environmental science community. Thus far JASMIN has been used primarily by the atmospheric science and earth observation communities, both to support their direct scientific workflow, and the curation of data products in the STFC Centre for Environmental Data Archival (CEDA). Initial JASMIN configuration and first experiences are reported here. Useful improvements in scientific workflow are presented. It is clear from the explosive growth in stored data and use that there was a pent up demand for a suitable big-data analysis environment. This demand is not yet satisfied, in part because JASMIN does not yet have enough compute, the storage is fully allocated, and not all software needs are met. Plans to address these constraints are introduced.&&&&&Communities,Meteorology,Earth,Data models,Data handling,Virtual machining,Data analysis$$$$$Big Data,data analysis,environmental science computing,pattern clustering,storage management$$$$$environmental big data,big data storage,big data manipulation,JASMIN super-data-cluster,high-performance high-volume data analysis,UK environmental science community,United Kingdom,scientific workflow,data products,STFC Centre for Environmental Data Archival,big data analysis,software needs$$$$$Curation,Climate,Earth Observation,Big Data,Cloud Computing
