Hadoop as Big Data Operating System -- The Emerging Approach for Managing Challenges of Enterprise Big Data Platform&&&&&Over last few years, innovation in Hadoop and other related Big Data technologies in last few years brings on to the table a lot of promises around better management of enterprise data at much lesser cost and with high value business benefits. In this paper, we propose to delve into details of these challenges from practitioners' perspective based on lessons learnt from various Big Data implementation scenarios. We also aim to discuss the emerging concept of Hadoop as Big Data Operating System to address these challenges with a holistic proposition. Finally, we also plan to provide a prescriptive approach based on best practices which can help moving towards the vision of Enterprise Big Data Platform using Hadoop as Data Operating System balancing between short term objectives and long term goals of managing and maintaining Enterprise Big Data Platform.&&&&&Big data,Operating systems,Industries,Production,Organizations,Engines$$$$$Big Data,business data processing,data mining,database management systems,operating systems (computers)$$$$$Hadoop,Big Data operating system,enterprise Big Data platform,Big Data technologies,enterprise data management,high value business benefits,data mining$$$$$Business analytics,Big Data,Data Mining,Map Reduce,Hadoop,NoSQL
