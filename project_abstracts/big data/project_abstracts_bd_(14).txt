A Study on Association Algorithm of Smart Campus Mining Platform Based on Big Data&&&&&In this thesis, jumping out of the traditional data statistic analysis method, the author constructs smart campus data platform and uses Apriori algorithm to make the association analysis on the learning and living data of students in campus in order to excavate their marks, basic information, attendance and states of internet use. In this way, the university can better guide the students to study based on the results of association analysis.&&&&&Transportation,Big Data,Smart cities$$$$$Big Data,data mining,educational administrative data processing,statistical analysis$$$$$association analysis,association algorithm,smart campus mining platform,big data,Apriori algorithm,student learning,student attendance,data statistic analysis method,smart campus data platform,student living data,internet use$$$$$Big Data,Smart Campus,Apriori Association Algorithm
