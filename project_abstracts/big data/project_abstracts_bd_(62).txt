A novel initialization method for particle swarm optimization-based FCM in big biomedical data&&&&&Based on empirical studies, the feature of random initialization in Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based Fuzzy c-means (FCM) methods affects the computational performance especially in big data. As the data points in high-density areas are more likely near the cluster centroids, we design a new algorithm to guide the initialization according to the data density patterns. Our algorithm is initialized by fusing the data characteristics near the cluster centers. Our evaluation results from real data show that our approach can significantly improve the computational performance of PSO-based Fuzzy clustering methods, while preserving comparable clustering performance.&&&&&Big data,Particle swarm optimization,Clustering algorithms,Algorithm design and analysis,Electronic mail,Bioinformatics,Solids$$$$$Big Data,fuzzy set theory,medical information systems,particle swarm optimisation,pattern clustering$$$$$initialization method,particle swarm optimization,big biomedical data,PSO,fuzzy c-means methods,FCM methods,cluster centroids,data density patterns,fuzzy clustering methods$$$$$Initialization,FCM,Patterns,Particle Swarm Optimization,Big Data
