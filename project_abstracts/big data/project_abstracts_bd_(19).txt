Discovering the interdisciplinary nature of big data research&&&&&The study presented in this poster aims to address the paucity of studies examining the interdisciplinary nature of Big Data research. Using bibliometric records of articles downloaded from the Web of Science (WoS), this study utilizes the co-occurrence data between Subject Categories (SCs) related to Big Data research to discover the structure and pattern of the interdisciplinary network; its distribution and evolution over time; and the structural communities of interdisciplinary collaboration. The study also provides visualizations of these interdisciplinary networks. Additionally, this study measures the degree of interdisciplinary collaboration in Big Data research based on the co-occurrences of SCs of the related research publications using Stirling's Diversity Index and Specialization Index.&&&&&Big Data,Collaboration,STEM,Indexes,Bibliometrics,Computer science,Data visualization$$$$$Big Data,citation analysis,social sciences$$$$$interdisciplinary collaboration,big data research,related research publications,co-occurrence data,bibliometric records,Web of Science articles,WoS articles,subject categories$$$$$Big Data,interdisciplinary collaboration,network structure and patterns,visualization,interdisciplinarity,measures,network analysis
