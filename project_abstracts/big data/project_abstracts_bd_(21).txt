Research and application on occupational hazards regulation big data&&&&&Big date application soars in commercial and data industries. By analyzing overall framework of occupational hazards regulation big date platform, process from the source to the end-user and the occupational hazards regulation big data application architecture was illustrated in this issue. The data integration, analysis, processing and display technologies were researched to meet the requirements of occupational hazards regulation. Key technologies of big data will bring a new development opportunity for the construction of occupational hazards regulation platform.&&&&&Big Data,Hazards,Data mining,Databases,Computer architecture,Data integration,Distributed computing$$$$$Big Data,data integration,occupational health,occupational stress$$$$$data integration,data analysis,data processing,data display technologies,occupational hazards regulation Big Data application architecture$$$$$big data,occupational hazards regulation,intelligent,platform
