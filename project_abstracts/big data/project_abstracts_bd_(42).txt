In Light of the Legal Debate over Personal Data Privacy at a Time of Globalized Big Data: Making Big Data Researchers Cooperating with Lawmakers to Find Solutions for the Future&&&&&At the same time as Big Data technologies are being constantly refined, the legislation relating to data privacy is changing. The invalidation by the Court of Justice of the European Union on October 6, 2015, of the agreement known as "Safe Harbor", negotiated by the European Commission on behalf of the European Union with the United States has two consequences. The first is to announce its replacement by a new, still fragile, program, the "Privacy Shield", which isn't yet definitive, which could also later be repealed by the Court of Justice of the European Union. For example, we are expecting to hear the opinion in mid-April 2016 of the group of data protection authorities for the various states of the European Union, known as G29. The second is to mobilize the Big Data community to take control of the question of data privacy management, to put in place an adequate internal program.&&&&&Europe,Law,Data privacy,Big data,Companies,Facebook$$$$$Big Data,data privacy,legislation$$$$$personal data privacy,globalized big data,big data researchers,legal debate,lawmakers,legislation,court of justice,European Union,safe harbor,European commission,United States,privacy shield,data protection authorities,G29$$$$$Big Data,Data Mining,Machine Learning,privacy,Data-Driven Intelligent Predictive Systems,personal data preservation,Privacy By Design,Safe Harbor,Privacy Shield
