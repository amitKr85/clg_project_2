Towards a requirements engineering artefact model in the context of big data software development projects: Research in progress&&&&&There is ample literature that suggests that the field of Big Data is growing rapidly. Also, there is emerging literature on the need to create end-user Big Data applications, as distinct from “data analytics” that typically employs machine learning algorithms to find value in large datasets for the stakeholder. A solid foundation for creating sound applications is a thorough understanding of domain and artefact models that embody artefact types and activities involved in a software project. This paper focuses on the Requirements Engineering (RE) aspect of a Big Data software project. Currently, there are no known RE artefact models to support RE process design and project understanding. To fill this void, this paper proposes a RE artefact model for Big Data end-user applications (BD-REAM). The paper also describes a method for creating the artefact model, including the basic elements and inter-relationships involved in the model.&&&&&Big Data,Software,Requirements engineering,Data models,Unified modeling language,Software engineering,Stakeholders$$$$$Big Data,formal specification$$$$$end-user Big Data applications,data analytics,process design,requirements engineering artefact model,Big Data software development projects,RE artefact models,BD-REAM$$$$$Big Data,Requirements Engineering,Artefact Model,Big Data Requirements Engineering Artfect Model
