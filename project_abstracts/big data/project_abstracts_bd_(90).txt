A strategic approach for visualizing the value of big data (SAVV-BIGD) framework&&&&&An organization and its environment are mutually related. By implication, as the business environment constantly evolves, business policies and strategies should be dynamic enough to adapt to and align with the changes impacting the organization. The term Big Data is fast becoming a buzz word and it is believed to carry huge amounts of benefits for both industries and academia. Big Data was initially defined by `3V's (Volume, Velocity & Variety) and most recently with additional `V's. While Big Data can greatly influence the operation of an Organisation, there is a need to first visualize the potential value that can be derived from a Big Data project. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to present a Big data Strategy expressed as the SAVV-BIGD framework that can be used to visualize the value of Big Data. Using Design Science Research Methodology, the framework is coined from the Co-evolutionary IS alignment framework by Benbya & McKelvey.&&&&&Big data,Organizations,Data visualization,Satellite broadcasting,Roads,Industries$$$$$Big Data,data visualisation$$$$$strategic approach for visualizing the value of Big Data,SAVV-BIGD framework,design science research methodology,co-evolutionary IS alignment framework$$$$$Big Data Strategy,SAVV-BIGD Framework,Big Data,Digital Business Strategy,Big Data Implementation,IS Alignment
