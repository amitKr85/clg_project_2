Communication Rules Learning Strategy in Big Data Network Based on SVN Neural Network&&&&&Big data system has great effect on improving the informational level of the application and demand. The Internet of things and wireless sensor network (WSN) is the typical manifestation of big data. Communication process of big data system can be done adopting various wireless communication rules which include 4G, WLAN and WAVE. As each wireless communication rule has different application scene applicability and different communication effects, this paper proposed a communication rules learning strategy based on SVN neural network. This strategy obtained learning samples which indicate the communication mode with best communication performance through simulation of various application scenes in OPENT Modeler. Through the study of neural network algorithm, this designed strategy can output the predicted result mode of wireless communication adaptively under unknown data application scenes. The outstanding results show that the learning strategy based on neural network can accurately choose the optimal communication rule in big data system.&&&&&Transportation,Big Data,Smart cities$$$$$Big Data,learning (artificial intelligence),neural nets,wireless sensor networks$$$$$communication effects,SVN neural network algorithm,data application scenes,WSN,WLAN,WAVE,OPENT Modeler,communication performance,communication mode,wireless communication rule,communication process,wireless sensor network,big data network,communication rules learning strategy,big data system,optimal communication rule$$$$$Big data,wireless Communication Rules,Neural Network,Communication Performance,OPENT Modeler
