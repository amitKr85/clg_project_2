Privacy-Aware Big Data Warehouse Architecture&&&&&Along with the ever increasing growth in data collection and its mining, there is an increasing fear of compromising individual and population privacy. Several techniques have been proposed in literature to preserve privacy of collected data while storing and processing. In this paper, we propose a privacy-aware architecture for storing and processing data in a Big Data warehouse. In particular, we propose a flexible, extendable, and adaptable architecture that enforces user specified privacy requirements in the form of Embedded Privacy Agreements. The paper discusses the details of the architecture with some implementation details.&&&&&Data privacy,Big data,Metadata,Servers,Privacy,Computer architecture$$$$$Big Data,data mining,data privacy,data warehouses$$$$$privacy-aware Big Data warehouse architecture,data collection,data mining,privacy preservation,data storing,data processing,flexible-extendable-adaptable architecture,embedded privacy agreements$$$$$architecture,big data,data warehouse,privacy enforcement,security
