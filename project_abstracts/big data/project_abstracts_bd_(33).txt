Big data challenges in China centre for resources satellite data and application&&&&&China Centre for Resources Satellite Data and Application (abbreviate as CRESDA) is a core platform to store, process, analyze, and distribute land observing satellite data in China. It can provide high quality and effective services for the State Council and the relevant departments of government and local authorities. In the era of big data, the data center benefits from big data opportunities as well as suffering from big data challenges. In the paper, the big data challenges of the CRESDA are summarized. In particular, four major challenges are comprised of the 3V dimensions of big data (i.e. Volume, Variety, and Velocity) and one specific challenge (i.e., extensibility) in the data center.&&&&&Satellites,Remote sensing,Big Data,Monitoring$$$$$artificial satellites,Big Data,geophysics computing,remote sensing$$$$$resources satellite data,land observing satellite data distribution,big data 3V dimensions,land observing satellite data processing,land observing satellite data analysis,land observing satellite data storage,CRESDA,China Centre for Resources Satellite Data and Application,data center$$$$$Land observing satellites,data center,big data,data challenges
