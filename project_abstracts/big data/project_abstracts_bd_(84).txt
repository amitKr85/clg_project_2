Tile based visual analytics for Twitter big data exploratory analysis&&&&&New tools for raw data exploration and characterization of “big data” sets are required to suggest initial hypotheses for testing. The widespread use and adoption of web-based geo maps have provided a familiar set of interactions for exploring extremely large geo data spaces and can be applied to similarly large abstract data spaces. Building on these techniques, a tile based visual analytics system (TBVA) was developed that demonstrates interactive visualization for a one billion point Twitter dataset. TBVA enables John Tukey-inspired exploratory data analysis to be performed on massive data sets of effectively unlimited size.&&&&&Tiles,Twitter,Visual analytics,Heating,Strips,Information management,Data handling$$$$$Big Data,cartography,data analysis,data visualisation,interactive systems,social networking (online)$$$$$tile based visual analytics system,Twitter big data exploratory analysis,Big data set characterization,Web-based geo maps,geo data spaces,abstract data spaces,TBVA,John Tukey-inspired exploratory data analysis,interactive Twitter dataset visualization$$$$$big data,visual analytics,exploratory data analysis
