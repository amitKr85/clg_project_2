Big data challenges in railway engineering&&&&&As Big Data becomes part of railroad data analysis, there are many challenges which need to be addressed by the railway industry. This extended abstract highlights some of the challenges from specific examples in railway engineering. This work does not present the challenges of dealing with Big Data in general which is beyond the scope of this paper. The examples provided in this extended abstract cover both the engineering and the management of railroad applications.&&&&&Big data,Rails,Rail transportation,Databases,Data analysis,Railway engineering,Geometry$$$$$Big Data,data analysis,railway engineering,railway industry$$$$$railway engineering,Big Data,railroad data analysis,railway industry$$$$$Big Data,Railway,Rail Defects,Geometry Defects,Privacy
