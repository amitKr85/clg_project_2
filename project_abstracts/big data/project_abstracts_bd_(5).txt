Cyber crime investigations in the era of big data&&&&&The amount of data seized in Crime Investigations has increased enormously. Investigators are more than ever confronted with vast amount of heterogeneous data, highly-diverse data formats, increased complexity in distributed stored information. With constantly increasing network bandwidth it makes extremely challenging to process or even store part of the network traffic. Nevertheless, criminal investigations need to solve crimes in a timely manners. New computational methods, infrastructure and algorithmic approaches are required. Although Big Data is a challenge for criminal investigators, it can also help them make to source an detect patterns to prevent and solve crimes. This paper aims to raise attention to current challenges in Cyber Crime Investigations - related to Big Data - and possible ways to approach combating cybercrimes.&&&&&Computer crime,Big Data,Digital forensics,Tools,Computers,Data analysis$$$$$Big Data,computer crime,security of data,storage management$$$$$distributed stored information,network bandwidth,network traffic,criminal investigations,criminal investigators,heterogeneous data,highly-diverse data formats,Big Data,cyber crime investigations$$$$$Digital Forensics,Big Data,Cyber Crime,Criminal Investigation,Computational Intelligence
