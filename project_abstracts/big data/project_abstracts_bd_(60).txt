Big data analytics as-a-service: Issues and challenges&&&&&Big Data domain is one of the most promising ICT sectors with substantial expectations both on the side of market growing and design shift in the area of data storage managment and analytics. However, today, the level of complexity achieved and the lack of standardisation of Big Data management architectures represent a huge barrier towards the adoption and execution of analytics especially for those organizations and SMEs not including a sufficient amount of competences and knowledge. The full potential of Big Data Analytics (BDA) can be unleashed only through the definition of approaches that accomplish Big Data users' expectations and requirements, also when the latter are fuzzy and ambiguous. Under these premises, we propose Big Data Analytics-as-a-Service (BDAaaS) as the next-generation Big Data Analytics paradigm and we discuss issues and challenges from the BDAaaS design and development perspective.&&&&&Big data,Organizations,Distributed databases,Data models,Pipelines,Complexity theory$$$$$Big Data,cloud computing,data analysis,small-to-medium enterprises$$$$$Big Data analytics as-a-service,BDAaaS,ICT,data storage managment,Big Data management architectures,organizations,SME$$$$$Big Data,Big Data analytics,Issue and challenges
