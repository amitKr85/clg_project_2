A Algorithm to Incremental Learning with Support Vector Machine and Its Application in Multi-class Classification&&&&&Support vector machine (SVM) is a new statistical learning method. By analyzing the theory and characteristics of SVM, this paper presents an algorithm of incremental learning. This algorithm is tested with multi-class classification and results show that this algorithm reduces the training time. Meanwhile, it keeps the testing accuracy.&&&&&Machine learning,Support vector machines,Support vector machine classification,Mathematics,Testing,Electronic mail,Statistical learning,Algorithm design and analysis,IEEE catalog,Mercury (metals)$$$$$learning (artificial intelligence),pattern classification,support vector machines$$$$$incremental learning,support vector machine,multiclass classification,statistical learning$$$$$Support Vector Machine (SVM),Incremental Learning,Multi-class Classification
