Pool-based active learning based on incremental decision tree&&&&&The pool-based active learning intends to collect the samples into the pool firstly, and selects the best informative sample from it which has no label to add into the training sets for updating the classifier secondly. This paper proposed a new method based on the incremental decision tree algorithm to measure the ambiguity of the unlabeled samples for the sample selection in the active learning.&&&&&Decision trees,Classification algorithms,Machine learning,Algorithm design and analysis,Accuracy,Training,Testing$$$$$decision trees,learning (artificial intelligence),pattern classification$$$$$pool-based active learning,training sets,classifier,incremental decision tree algorithm,sample selection$$$$$Pool-based active learning,Incremental decision tree,Ambiguity,Unlabeled samples,Sample selection
