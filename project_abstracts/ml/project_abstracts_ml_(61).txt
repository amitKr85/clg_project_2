Applying Learning by Tutelage and Multimodal Interface to Sociable Robots&&&&&In this article, a learning mechanism and a multimodal interface are presented. The learning mechanism allows the robot to learn concepts of the environment by human tutelage. The multimodal interface employs mechanisms of face detection, pose estimation, object saliency and speech recognition. The learning mechanism and multimodal interface are evaluated in the context of concept learning.&&&&&Face detection,Learning systems,Machine vision,Color,Speech recognition,Robot vision systems,Machine learning,Human robot interaction,Principal component analysis,Neural networks$$$$$human-robot interaction,intelligent robots,learning (artificial intelligence)$$$$$tutelage,sociable robots,multimodal interface,learning,face detection,pose estimation,object saliency,speech recognition$$$$$Sociable robots,machine learning,learning by tutelage,multimodal interface,robotic architecture
