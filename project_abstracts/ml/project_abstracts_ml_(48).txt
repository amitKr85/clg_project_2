Deep Multiple Kernel Learning&&&&&Deep learning methods have predominantly been applied to large artificial neural networks. Despite their state-of-the-art performance, these large networks typically do not generalize well to datasets with limited sample sizes. In this paper, we take a different approach by learning multiple layers of kernels. We combine kernels at each layer and then optimize over an estimate of the support vector machine leave-one-out error rather than the dual objective function. Our experiments on a variety of datasets show that each layer successively increases performance with only a few base kernels.&&&&&Kernel,Upper bound,Support vector machines,Accuracy,Complexity theory,Linear programming,Training$$$$$learning (artificial intelligence),neural nets,support vector machines$$$$$deep multiple kernel learning,artificial neural network,support vector machine,leave-one-out error$$$$$Deep Learning,Multiple Kernel Learning,Kernels,Support Vector Machine
