A study on the relationship among learning path, learning style, and e-learning performance&&&&&As the applications of information technologies gain more and more popularity; e-learning has been an important tool in education. Besides traditional instructions, e-learning needs appropriate guidance and support to enhance learners' learning effectiveness. This study aims to investigate the impact of e-learners' learning paths, and their learning styles on their leaning performance. The major findings can be listed as follows: (1) path-controlled learning method performs significantly better than random one; (2) sequential and iterative learning paths perform significantly better than free one. Consequently, it's very helpful for the e-learning Web site designers to provide useful guidance and support, as well as manipulate properly the learning path to enhance learners' learning performance consequently.&&&&&Electronic learning,Learning systems,Education,Machine learning,Web sites,Mathematics,Cybernetics$$$$$computer aided instruction,Web design$$$$$e-learning performance,learning effectiveness,path-controlled learning method,Web site designers$$$$$E-learning,Kolb learning style,Learning path,Web mining
