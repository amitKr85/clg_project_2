A machine learning approach for the classification of cardiac arrhythmia&&&&&Rapid advancements in technology have facilitated early diagnosis of diseases in the medical sector. One of the most prevalent medical conditions that demands early diagnosis is cardiac arrhythmia. ECG signals can be used to classify and detect the type of cardiac arrhythmia. This paper introduces a novel approach to classify the ECG data into one of the sixteen types of arrhythmia using Machine Learning. The proposed method uses the UCI Machine Learning Repository [1] dataset of cardiac arrhythmia to train the system on 279 different attributes. In order to increase the accuracy, the method uses Principal Component Analysis for dimensionality reduction, Bag of Visual Words approach for clustering and compares different classification algorithms like Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbor algorithms, thus choosing the most accurate algorithm, Support Vector Machine.&&&&&Feature extraction,Electrocardiography,Classification algorithms,Support vector machines,Principal component analysis,Histograms,Machine learning algorithms$$$$$diseases,electrocardiography,learning (artificial intelligence),medical signal processing,principal component analysis,regression analysis,signal classification,support vector machines$$$$$UCI Machine Learning Repository dataset,ECG data classification,principal component analysis,dimensionality reduction,bag of visual words approach,random forest algorithm,logistic regression algorithm,K-nearest neighbor algorithm,prevalent medical conditions,medical sector,cardiac arrhythmia,machine learning approach,Support Vector Machine$$$$$Machine Learning,Artificial Intelligence,Classification,Bag of Visual Words,Clustering,Cardiac Arrhythmia
