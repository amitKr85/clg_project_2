Direct kernel method for machine learning with support vector machine&&&&&Support vector machine (SVM) based intrusion detection system (IDS) presently working as the machine learning approach for classification. It helps to detect new attacks from the datasets which are used in the machine learning. At IDS, the task of the machine learning method is to construct a projectile model which can be distinguished between normal and illegitimate activity. Any IDS can be developed to get high accuracy, high detection rate and low false positive rate, which show the efficiency of that intrusion detection system. In this paper, we use a direct kernel method with SVM classifier to get the high accuracy and detection rate, also low false positive rate.

However, encryption is one of the factors to make application identification difficult, because it is so hard to infer the original (unencrypted) packets from encrypted packets. As a result, the accuracy of application identification is getting worse as the increase of encrypted traffic. In this paper, we propose a method to increase the accuracy of application identification whatever the traffic is encrypted or not.

CIL consists of two phases: incremental feature selection and incremental training, for updating the knowledge of old SVM classifiers in text classification when new classes are added to the system. CIL reuses the old models of the classifier and learns only one binary sub-classifier with an additional phase of feature selection when a new class comes. In the testing phase, current classifier is applied to the vectors' projections on the sub-spaces concerned. CIL can serve as a flexible approach for all binary classification algorithms in text classification. Our experiment shows that the CIL-based SVM was not only substantially faster in training time than the popular batch SVM learning methods such as 1-against-rest, 1-against-1 and divide-by-2 but also almost competed to the best performances in effectiveness of them&&&&&Learning systems,Support vector machines,Support vector machine classification,Text categorization,Machine learning,Information filtering,Information filters,Decision trees,Automation,Electronic mail$$$$$classification,feature extraction,information filtering,Internet,learning (artificial intelligence),support vector machines,text analysis$$$$$class-incremental learning method,multiclass support vector machine,text classification,incremental feature selection,incremental training,SVM classifier,binary classification algorithm,Internet information filtering$$$$$Machine learning,class-incremental learning,support vector machines,text classification,feature selection,Internet information filtering#####A Algorithm to Incremental Learning with Support Vector Machine and Its Application in Multi-class Classification&&&&&Support vector machine (SVM) is a new statistical learning method.

This is used to model the student's learning strategy (mis)selection. Plausible justification trees are generated for the learning strategies, one of which is correct while the others lead to a mis-learning. The mistake by the student is traced back to either a mistake in the application of the subject knowledge or a mistake in the learnt knowledge.

This paper addresses the problem of applying machine learning methods for the development of an agent, which plays Hearthstone. We show how to separate a large action space of Hearthstone in two parts, one of which is quite small, in order to apply reinforcement learning. Also we develop a new tree-walking algorithm which allows us to consider only the most promising game states of Hearthstone in order to determine the best action sequence on a given turn. Besides that, we propose a new way to train and build a game state metric using supervised learning techniques. We develop four agents based on these proposals. Two of them show better results compared to previous works. Lastly, we show that the best developed agent can compete with game experts.&&&&&Games,Feature extraction,Measurement,Supervised learning,Generators,Training,Learning (artificial intelligence)$$$$$computer games,learning (artificial intelligence),multi-agent systems,trees (mathematics)$$$$$reinforcement learning,supervised learning techniques,machine learning methods,tree-walking algorithm,game state metric,Hearthstone,digital trading card game,action sequence$$$$$Machine-learning,-Supervised-learning,-Backpropagation,-Artificial-intelligence,-Multi-layer-neural-network#####When brain and behavior disagree: Tackling systematic label noise in EEG data with machine learning&&&&&Conventionally, neuroscientific data is analyzed based on the behavioral response of the participant. This approach assumes that behavioral errors of participants are in line with the neural processing. However, this may not be the case, in particular in experiments with time pressure or studies investigating the threshold of perception. In these cases, the error distribution deviates from uniformity due to the heteroscedastic nature of the underlying experimental set-up. This problem of systematic and structured (non-uniform) label noise is ignored when analysis are based on behavioral data, as is being done typically. Thus, we run the risk to arrive at wrong conclusions in our analysis. This paper proposes a remedy to handle this crucial problem: we present a novel approach for a) measuring label noise and b) removing structured label noise. We show its usefulness for an EEG data set recorded during a standard d2 test for visual attention.&&&&&Electroencephalography,Noise,Visualization,Support vector machines,Brain modeling,Electrodes,Kernel$$$$$behavioural sciences computing,electroencephalography,learning (artificial intelligence),medical signal processing,neurophysiology,signal denoising$$$$$brain,behavior disagree,systematic label noise,machine learning,neuroscientific data,participant behavioral response,participant behavioral errors,neural processing,perception threshold,error distribution,heteroscedastic nature,behavioral data,label noise measurement,structured label noise removal,EEG data set,standard d2 test,visual attention$$$$$EEG,Label Noise,Machine Learning,Unsupervised Learning,Applied Cognitive Neuroscience#####Selecting Examples in Manifold Reduced Feature Space for Active Learning&&&&&Nowadays machine learning are faced with an overload of data, both in terms of examples and features. Although recent algorithms, like support vector machines, can handle high dimensionality, it remains valuable to find smaller and more fitted spaces to perform learning tasks. We propose a twofold approach to tackle these high dimensionality issues in a text classification setting. First we use manifold learning as a pre-processing step to nonlinearly reduce the feature space. Second we use support vector machines to implement an active learning strategy, where the kernel trick is used to define the active examples. This approach deals with the high dimensionality both reducing the features and the number of examples needed to reach a desired performance.Results on a real-world benchmark corpus from Reuters and also on a reduced realistic version of the corpus show first the visualization capabilities of manifold learning and the performance improvement achieved with the active learning strategy.&&&&&Machine learning,Manifolds,Support vector machines,Space technology,Text categorization,Machine learning algorithms,Support vector machine classification,Data visualization,Supervised learning,Learning systems$$$$$classification,learning (artificial intelligence),support vector machines,text analysis$$$$$active machine learning,support vector machine,manifold learning,manifold reduced feature space,text classification setting$$$$$Active learning,manifold learning,feature selection,text classification#####A kind of hybrid classification algorithm based on rough set and support vector machine&&&&&Support vector machine (SVM) is a new machine learning method and it has greater generalization performance.

First, 8 different machine learning algorithms are applied to the data, without applying any feature selection methods. Then two different feature selection methods are applied. The results of the classifications are compared with each other and with the results of the first case. The methods applied are SVM, KNN, MLP, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Adaboost and Gradient Boosting Machines. After applying the two different feature selection methods with the best 50 features are applied, SVM gave the best results. MLP is applied using different number of layers and neurons to examine the effect of the number of layers and neurons on the classification accuracy. It is determined that the increase in the number of layers sometimes decreased, sometimes didn't change the accuracy.&&&&&Feature extraction,Support vector machines,Machine learning,Machine learning algorithms,Neurons,Breast cancer$$$$$cancer,decision trees,feature selection,medical computing,multilayer perceptrons,nearest neighbour methods,pattern classification,regression analysis,support vector machines$$$$$classification accuracy,microarray breast cancer data classification,machine learning methods,logistic regression,random forest,decision trees,MLP,KNN,SVM,gradient boosting machines,feature selection methods,machine learning algorithms$$$$$Machine learning algorithms,feature selection methods,microarray technology#####Deep Neural Networks with Parallel Autoencoders for Learning Pairwise Relations: Handwritten Digits Subtraction&&&&&Modelling relational data is a common task for many machine learning problems. In this work, we focus on learning pairwise relations between two entities, with deep neural networks. To incorporate the structural properties in the data that represent two entities concatenated together, two separate stacked autoencoders are introduced in parallel to extract individual features, which are then fed into a deep neural network for classification. The method is applied to a specific problem: whether two input handwritten digits differ by one. We tested the performance on a dataset generated from handwritten digits in MNIST, which is a widely used dataset for testing different machine learning techniques and pattern recognition methods. We compared with several different machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression and support vector machines, on this handwritten digit subtraction (HDS) dataset. The results showed that deep neural networks outperformed other methods, and in particular, the deep neural networks fitted with two separate autoencoders in parallel increased the prediction accuracy from 85.83%, which was achieved by a standard neural network with a single stacked autoencoder, to 88.27%.&&&&&Feature extraction,Machine learning,Biological neural networks,Kernel,Machine learning algorithms,Support vector machines$$$$$handwritten character recognition,image classification,image coding,learning (artificial intelligence),neural nets,regression analysis,relational databases,support vector machines$$$$$pairwise relation learning,deep neural networks,relational data modelling,structural properties,stacked autoencoders,parallel stacked autoencoders,classification,MNIST,machine learning techniques,pattern recognition method,logistic regression,support vector machines,handwritten digit subtraction dataset,HDS dataset$$$$$Deep learning,relational learning,parallel autoencoders,neural networks,machine learning#####A machine learning approach for the classification of cardiac arrhythmia&&&&&Rapid advancements in technology have facilitated early diagnosis of diseases in the medical sector. One of the most prevalent medical conditions that demands early diagnosis is cardiac arrhythmia. ECG signals can be used to classify and detect the type of cardiac arrhythmia. This paper introduces a novel approach to classify the ECG data into one of the sixteen types of arrhythmia using Machine Learning. The proposed method uses the UCI Machine Learning Repository [1] dataset of cardiac arrhythmia to train the system on 279 different attributes. In order to increase the accuracy, the method uses Principal Component Analysis for dimensionality reduction, Bag of Visual Words approach for clustering and compares different classification algorithms like Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbor algorithms, thus choosing the most accurate algorithm, Support Vector Machine.&&&&&Feature extraction,Electrocardiography,Classification algorithms,Support vector machines,Principal component analysis,Histograms,Machine learning algorithms$$$$$diseases,electrocardiography,learning (artificial intelligence),medical signal processing,principal component analysis,regression analysis,signal classification,support vector machines$$$$$UCI Machine Learning Repository dataset,ECG data classification,principal component analysis,dimensionality reduction,bag of visual words approach,random forest algorithm,logistic regression algorithm,K-nearest neighbor algorithm,prevalent medical conditions,medical sector,cardiac arrhythmia,machine learning approach,Support Vector Machine$$$$$Machine Learning,Artificial Intelligence,Classification,Bag of Visual Words,Clustering,Cardiac Arrhythmia#####Exploiting Ensemble Method in Semi-Supervised Learning&&&&&In many practical machine learning fields, obtaining labeled data is hard and expensive. Semi-supervised learning is very useful in these fields since it combines labeled and unlabeled data to boost performance of learning algorithms. Many semi-supervised learning algorithms have been proposed, among which the "co-training" algorithms are widely used. We present a new co-training strategy. It uses random subspace method to form an initial ensemble of classifiers, where each classifier is trained with different subspace of the original feature space. Unlike the prior work of Blum and Mitchell on co-training, using two redundant and sufficient views, our method uses an ensemble of classifiers. Each classifier's predictions on new unlabeled data are combined and used to enlarge the training set of others. The ensemble classifiers are refined through the enlarged training set. Experiments on UCI data sets show that when the number of labeled data is relatively small, our method performs better than the data dimensionality&&&&&Semisupervised learning,Machine learning algorithms,Partitioning algorithms,Machine learning,Supervised learning,Information technology,Support vector machines,Web pages,Prediction algorithms,Labeling$$$$$learning (artificial intelligence),pattern classification$$$$$ensemble method,semisupervised learning algorithm,machine learning field,co-training algorithm,random subspace method,UCI data sets$$$$$Semi-supervised learning,ensemble classifier,random subspace method,co-training#####Incremental learning proximal support vector machine classifiers&&&&&Support vector machines (SVMs) have played a key role in broad classes of problems in various fields. However, with increasing amounts of data being generated by businesses and researchers, SVMs suffer from the problem of large memory requirement and CPU time when trained in batch mode on large data sets.

Therefore, this study aims to automatically classify mobile application user reviews. Automatic classification conducted in this study is using machine learning approach. The features extracted from user review are unigram, bigram, star rating, review length, as well as the ratio of the number of words with positive and negative sentiment. For classification algorithms, we used Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression and Decision Tree. The experiment result shows that Logistic Regression gives the best F-Measure of 85% when combined with unigram plus sentence length and sentiment score. Unigram was proven as the most important feature since the additional features like sentence length and sentiment score only increased the F-measure around 1%. Bigram and star rating has negative impact on the classifier performance.&&&&&Machine learning algorithms,Support vector machines,Lenses,Feature extraction,Machine learning,Computer bugs,Logistics$$$$$Bayes methods,decision trees,feature extraction,learning (artificial intelligence),mobile computing,natural language processing,pattern classification,regression analysis,support vector machines$$$$$mobile application review classification,Indonesian language,machine learning approach,mobile application user reviews,automatic classification,positive sentiment,negative sentiment,classification algorithms,Naïve Bayes,sentence length,sentiment score,support vector machine,logistic regression,mobile app development$$$$$classification,app review,text mining,machine learning#####Unauthorized Access Point Detection Using Machine Learning Algorithms for Information Protection&&&&&With the frequent use of Wi-Fi and hotspots that provide a wireless Internet environment, awareness and threats to wireless AP (Access Point) security are steadily increasing. Especially when using unauthorized APs in company, government and military facilities, there is a high possibility of being subjected to various viruses and hacking attacks.

The set of the base classifiers is fixed in traditional MCSs. When applying MCSs in online learning environment, the base classifiers have to be updated frequently to adapt the change of the environment. However, updating classifiers is time consumed, especially when the number of base classifier is big. Therefore, a selection method with dynamic base classifier pool is proposed in this paper. Rather than updating the existing base classifiers, a new base classifier is added to MCSs. The new base classifier is trained by using the samples which far away from the training set. Experimental results show that that the proposed method outperforms the MCSs with the fix base classifier pool in term of accuracy.&&&&&Training,Accuracy,Testing,Cancer,Machine learning,Cybernetics,Diversity reception$$$$$learning (artificial intelligence),pattern classification$$$$$dynamic base classifier pool,classifier selection,multiple classifier systems,MCS,online learning environment$$$$$Dynamic base classifier pool,Classifier selection,Dynamically adding,Neighborhood#####Instances selection for NN with fuzzy rough technique&&&&&The NN algorithm is a simple and well-known supervised learning scheme which classifies an unseen instance by finding its closest neighbor in training set. The main drawback of NN is that the whole training set must be stored in the computer to classify an unseen instance. In order to deal with this problem, P. Hart proposed the condensed nearest neighbor (CNN) algorithm. However, CNN select the important instances from the whole training set, which suffers from the problem of large memory requirement same as NN. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to select instances from the border region with fuzzy rough technique.

In our former study, we have proposed a feature weighting method based on the Localized Generalization Error Model (L-GEM). The function of weighting those inputs is influential to the performance of resulting classifiers. However, there are few researches focusing on how to use feature weights in a better way. In this paper, we study data scaling function for automatic image annotation with Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN).

Due to the good generalization capability, SVMs have been widely used in classification, regression and pattern recognition. In this paper, for the data with numerical condition attributes and decision attributes, a new fuzzy classification method (FCM) based on SVM is proposed. This method first fuzzifies decision attributes to some classes (linguistic terms), then trains decision function (classifier). For a new sample, the decision function doesn't forecast the value of its decision attribute, but gives the corresponding class and its membership degree as fuzzy decision. This fuzzy decision result is more objective and easier to understand than crisp decision in common sense. The design principle is given and the classification algorithm is implemented in this paper. The experimental results show that the new method proposed in this paper is effective.

The type of treatment recommended for an individual is influenced by various factors such as cancer-type, the severity of a cancer (stage) and most important the genetic heterogeneity. In such a complex environment, the targeted drug treatments are likely to be irresponsive or respond differently. To study anti-cancer drug response we need to understand cancerous profiles. These cancerous profiles carry information which can reveal the underlying factors responsible for cancer growth. Hence, there is need to analyze cancer data for predicting optimal treatment options. Analysis of such profiles can help to predict and discover potential drug targets and drugs.

Despite the fact that a wide range of machine learning methods have been applied to probabilistic energy prediction, the deep learning ones certainly represent the state-of-the-art artificial intelligence methods with remarkable success in a spectrum of practical applications. In particular, the use of Multi Layer Perceptrons, recently enhanced with deep learning capabilities, is proposed. Furthermore, its performance is compared with the most commonly used machine learning methods, such as Support Vector Machines, Gaussian Processes, Regression Trees, Ensemble Boosting and Linear Regression. The analysis of the day-ahead energy prediction demonstrates that different prediction methods present significantly different levels of accuracy in the case of a challenging dataset that comprises an interesting mix of consumers, wind and solar generation.

The proposed method has two novel features. One is its use of support vector machine (SVM) to estimate the subjective correctness of pitch accent with respect to each accent phrase of possible candidate speech segments. The other is its use of a determination function to identify the best segment based on SVM output. The determination function involves two assessments; one counts the number of each sign of SVM output and the other compares the distance values. The sign of SVM output is generally used to classify target objects, but the distance SVM output also represents important information. An experiment that assesses SVM performance for Japanese accent validity shows that its accuracy is 81%. To confirm the effectiveness of the proposed segment selection method, preference tests are conducted. The test indicates that the proposed method can yield Japanese synthesized speech with more natural intonation than the conventional method that uses only target cost and concatenation cost.&&&&&Machine learning,Speech synthesis,Support vector machines,Speech analysis,Support vector machine classification,Cost function,Testing,Natural languages,Laboratories,Humans$$$$$learning (artificial intelligence),speech synthesis,support vector machines$$$$$speech segment selection method,tonal validity evaluation,machine learning,concatenative speech synthesis,support vector machine,SVM output,Japanese accent validity$$$$$concatenative speech synthesis,segment selection,accent,machine learning#####Analysis of Machine learning Techniques Used in Behavior-Based Malware Detection&&&&&The increase of malware that are exploiting the Internet daily has become a serious threat. The manual heuristic inspection of malware analysis is no longer considered effective and efficient compared against the high spreading rate of malware. Hence, automated behavior-based malware detection using machine learning techniques is considered a profound solution. The behavior of each malware on an emulated (sandbox) environment will be automatically analyzed and will generate behavior reports. These reports will be preprocessed into sparse vector models for further machine learning (classification). The classifiers used in this research are k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Naïve Bayes, J48 Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (MlP). Based on the analysis of the tests and experimental results of all the 5 classifiers, the overall best performance was achieved by J48 decision tree with a recall of 95.9%, a false positive rate of 2.4%, a precision of 97.3%, and an accuracy of 96.8%.

However, one of the difficulties radiation oncologists face is targeting moving tumors, such as those in the lung, which can change position during normal respiration. Tumor motion can be determined by directly monitoring tumor position using continuous xray imaging or electromagnetic transponders placed in the tumor that emit a signal. These approaches require potentially unnecessary radiation to the patient or acquisition of expensive technology. Alternatively, one can image the patient intermittently to determine tumor location and external markers placed on the patient's torso. The external surrogates can then be used to determine an inferential model that would determine the tumor position as a function of external surrogates. These external surrogates can be monitored continuously in order to determine the real-time position of the tumor. In this study, we evaluate a machine learning algorithm for inferring intra-fraction tumor motion from external markers using a database of Cyberknife SynchronyTM system.&&&&&Machine learning,Patient monitoring,Biomedical applications of radiation,Cancer,Lung neoplasms,Optical imaging,Electromagnetic radiation,Transponders,Torso,Machine learning algorithms$$$$$biology computing,biomedical imaging,cancer,learning (artificial intelligence),radiation therapy,tumours,X-ray imaging$$$$$machine learning,intra-fraction tumor motion modeling,respiratory surrogates,radiation therapy,cancer,healthy tissues,radiation oncologists,normal respiration,tumor position monitoring,continuous x-ray imaging,electromagnetic transponders,tumor location,patient torso,real-time tumor position,Cyberknife Synchrony¿ system database#####Weighted support vector machine for classification with uneven training class sizes&&&&&In the standard support vector machines for classification, training sets with uneven class sizes results in classification biases towards the class with the large training size. That is to say, the larger the training sample size for one class is, the smaller its corresponding classification error rate is, while the smaller the sample size, the larger the classification error rate. The main causes lie in that the penalty of misclassification for each training sample is considered equally. Weighted support vector machines for classification are proposed in this paper where penalty of misclassification for each training sample is different. By setting the equal penalty for the training samples belonging to same class, and setting the ratio of penalties for different classes to the inverse ratio of the training class sizes, the obtained weighted support vector machines compensate for the undesirable effects caused by the uneven training class size, and the classification accuracy for the class with small training size is improved.

Unfortunately, the failure of ELM on big data occurs frequently.

In this paper, a new method for gradual transition detection that applies support vector machine is proposed. First, an improved variance projection function is introduced, and its practicality to the detection of gradual transition is analyzed as well. Then by using this variance projection function, the distance between the video frames is defined, and a method to calculate the feature vector of changes of the distance is proposed. Finally, a statistical learning method based on the support vector machine is devised to determine whether the changes of the distance are caused by gradual transition or not.

Many algorithms have been developed in the machine learning, statistical data mining, and pattern classification communities that perform such tasks with remarkable accuracy. Many of these algorithms, however, when implemented in software, suffer poor frame rates due to the amount and complexity of the computation involved.

Though traditional methods such as feature ranking and subset selection have been widely used, there has been little consideration given to assuring satisfactory performance of a learning machine in relation to the minimum of features required or the “critical dimension”. This critical dimension is unique to a specific dataset, learning machine, and ranking algorithm combination. The empirical methods demonstrate that many datasets show the existence of critical dimension. The dependence of this critical dimension on the learning machines and ranking algorithms could provide newer insights in understanding datasets, machine learning classifiers and ranking algorithms. The preliminary results of analysis show that the critical dimension depends largely on the feature ranking algorithm and that learning machines are less significant in determining the critical dimension.&&&&&Machine learning,Accuracy,Machine learning algorithms,Support vector machines,Niobium,Feature extraction,Radio frequency$$$$$data mining,learning (artificial intelligence),pattern classification$$$$$critical dimension dependance,machine learning classifiers,ranking methods,feature reduction,data mining,feature ranking algorithm,subset selection,ranking algorithm combination,empirical methods$$$$$Feature reduction,ranking,machine learning#####Horizon Detection Using Machine Learning Techniques&&&&&Detecting a horizon in an image is an important part of many image related applications such as detecting ships on the horizon, flight control, and port security. Most of the existing solutions for the problem only use image processing methods to identify a horizon line in an image. This results in good accuracy for many cases and is fast in computation. However, for some images with difficult environmental conditions like a foggy or cloudy sky these image processing methods are inherently inaccurate in identifying the correct horizon. This paper investigates how to detect the horizon line in a set of images using a machine learning approach.

To meet computational requirements, and power and scalability challenges, FPGA based Hardware accelerators have found their way in data centers and cloud infrastructures. Recent efforts on HW acceleration of big data mainly attempt to accelerate a particular application and deploy it on a specific architecture that fits well its performance and power requirements. Given the diversity of architectures and ML applications, the important research question is which architecture is better suited to meet the performance, power and energy-efficiency requirements of a diverse range of ML-based analytics applications. In this work, we answer this question by investigating how the type of FPGA (low-end vs. high-end), and its integration with the CPU (on-chip vs. off-chip) along with the choice of CPU (high performance big vs. low power little servers) affects the speedup yield and power reduction in a CPU+FPGA architecture for machine learning applications implemented in MapReduce. We show that among the three architectural parameters, the type of CPU is the most dominant factor in determining the execution time and power in a CPU+FPGA architecture for MapReduce applications.

During Q-learning, an agent makes action selections in an effort to maximize a reward signal obtained from the environment. Based on reward, agent will make changes in its policy for future actions. The problem considered in this paper is the overestimation of expected value of cumulative future discounted rewards. This discounted reward is used in evaluating agent actions and policy during reinforcement learning. Due to the overestimation of discounted reward action evaluation and policy changes are not accurate. The solution to this problem results from a form Q-learning algorithm using a combination of approximation spaces and Q-learning to estimate the expected value of returns on actions. This is made possible by considering behavior patterns of an agent in scope of approximation spaces. The framework provided by an approximation space makes it possible to measure the degree that agent behaviors are a part of (''covered by'') a set of accepted agent behaviors that serve as a behavior evaluation norm.&&&&&Computer science,Machine learning,Paper technology,Machine learning algorithms,Set theory,Approximation algorithms,Extraterrestrial measurements,State estimation,Learning systems,Optimization methods$$$$$learning (artificial intelligence),rough set theory$$$$$Q-learning algorithm,rough set theory,Zdzislaw Pawlak,reinforcement learning,reward action evaluation,behavior patterns$$$$$Reinforcement Learning,Q-learning Algorithm,Overestimation of Q-Values,Approximate Q-learning Algorithm#####Active learning for classification of remote sensing images&&&&&This paper presents an analysis of active learning techniques for the classification of remote sensing images and proposes a novel active learning method based on support vector machines (SVMs).

To shed more light on this, we ran an EEG study in which we asked participants (N=6) to discriminate on a behavioral level between visual stimuli in which they perceived flicker and those that they perceived as constant wave light. We found that high frequency flicker which is not perceived consciously anymore still elicits a neural response in the corresponding frequency band of EEG, con-tralateral to the stimulated hemifield. The main contribution of this paper is to show the benefit of machine learning techniques for investigating this effect of subconscious processing: Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) filtering in combination with classification based on Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) could be used to reveal the effect for additional participants and stimuli, with high statistical significance. We conclude that machine learning techniques are a valuable extension of conventional neurophysiological analysis that can substantially boost the sensitivity to subconscious effects, such as the processing of imperceptible flicker.&&&&&Electroencephalography,Machine learning,Visualization,Light sources,Humans,Light emitting diodes,Training$$$$$electroencephalography,filtering theory,learning (artificial intelligence),medical signal processing,signal classification,visual evoked potentials,visual perception$$$$$neural response,imperceptible peripheral flicker,machine learning,lighting,steady state visually evoked potential,SSVEP,electroencephalogram,low frequency EEG,visual stimuli,constant wave light,high frequency flicker,EEG frequency band,subconscious processing,common spatial pattern filtering,CSP filtering,LDA based classification,linear discriminant analysis$$$$$Adult,Artificial Intelligence,Electroencephalography,Female,Flicker Fusion,Humans,Male#####Facial expression recognition system using machine learning&&&&&This paper proposes a novel facial expression recognition system based on image features. There are two main processes in the proposed system, which are face detection and facial expression recognition (FER). The face detection process uses Haar-like features, and the region of interest is reset to reduce the variable of appearance changes. The FER process extracts histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) features from each facial region, and then, support vector machine is performed to classify the final facial expression. In the experimental results, the system exactly recognized the facial expression of a certain person, and the proposed system had the F1 score of 0.8759.&&&&&Feature extraction,Face recognition,Support vector machines,Face detection,Image recognition,Machine learning$$$$$emotion recognition,face recognition,feature extraction,learning (artificial intelligence),support vector machines$$$$$machine learning,image features,face detection process,Haar-like features,FER process,facial region,support vector machine,facial expression recognition system,region of interest,HOG features,histogram of oriented gradients features$$$$$machine learning,supervised learning,facial expression recognition#####Support Vector Machine for Classification Based on Fuzzy Training Data&&&&&Support vector machines (SVMs) have been very successful in pattern recognition and function estimation problems, but in the support vector machines for classification, the training examples are non-fuzzy input and output is y=plusmn1;.

First, the results calculated by the traditional node trust value calculation method and some auxiliary information are used as the training feature of the machine learning, and the measurement whether there is edge between nodes as label information. Second, the node logistic regression model is used as the training model to calculate the node trust value. Then, recommendation algorithm which is analogous to the user collaborative filtering algorithm is used to calculate node trust value. At last, the simulation is used to verify the performance of the improved method, and the results show that the prediction accuracy of node trust value computing by improved algorithm is significantly higher than that of node trust value computing by formula.&&&&&Training,Social network services,Logistics,Prediction algorithms,Indexes,Machine learning algorithms,Predictive models$$$$$collaborative filtering,information filtering,learning (artificial intelligence),recommender systems,regression analysis,social networking (online),trusted computing$$$$$machine learning method,traditional node trust value calculation method,node logistic regression model,node trust value computing,social network model,social network information$$$$$trust value,machine learning,social network#####Time series prediction via new support vector machines&&&&&In this paper, we present new support vector machines - least squares support vector machines (LS-SVMs). While standard SVMs solutions involve solving quadratic or linear programming problems, the least squares version of SVMs corresponds to solving a set of linear equations, due to equality instead of inequality constraints in the problem formulation. In LS-SVMs, the Mercer condition is still applicable. Hence several types of kernels such as polynomial, RBF's and MLP's can be used. Here we use LS-SVMs for time series prediction compared with radial basis function neural networks. We consider a noisy (Gaussian and uniform noise) Mackey-Glass time series. The results show that our least squares support vector machines are excellent for time series prediction even with high noise.&&&&&Support vector machines,Machine learning,Neural networks,Support vector machine classification,Gaussian noise,Statistical learning,Kernel,Chaos,Radial basis function networks,Least squares methods$$$$$learning automata,time series,learning (artificial intelligence),least squares approximations,radial basis function networks,Gaussian noise$$$$$Mackey-Glass time series,time series prediction,least squares support vector machines,linear equations,equality constraints,Mercer condition,radial basis function neural networks,Gaussian noise,uniform noise,high noise,machine learning,statistical learning theory#####Study of nonlinear system identification based on support vector machine&&&&&System identification plays an important role in control field.

This paper presents image processing and machine learning techniques for predicting chicken egg weight and classifying egg size number from a single egg image. A brown chicken egg is candled and its image is taken as an input to the algorithm. The egg image region is segmented from the background. Thirteen features are computed from geometric parameters acquired from the egg region. The weight of the egg is predicted and the size number is classified using the 13 features. The experiment shows that using the linear regression technique to predict the weight yielded the correlation coefficient of 0.9915, and the experiment using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) technique for classifying the size number yielded 87.58% accuracy.&&&&&Classification algorithms,Feature extraction,Support vector machines,Machine learning algorithms,Image segmentation,Linear regression$$$$$feature extraction,food products,image processing,learning (artificial intelligence),pattern classification,production engineering computing,regression analysis,support vector machines$$$$$chicken egg weight,single egg image,brown chicken egg,egg image region,linear regression technique,Support Vector Machine technique,egg weight prediction,egg grading,image processing,egg size number,egg size classification,machine learning,SVM$$$$$egg weight,egg size,image processing,machine learning#####Development of an interactive e-learning system to improve manufacturing technology education&&&&&The manufacturing technique covers: turning, milling, drilling, holing etc. Much time and cost are used to teach these techniques. Particularly, computerized machines are continuously increasing in use. The development of educating engineers on computerized machines becomes much more difficult than with traditional machines. This is because of the limitation of the extremely expensive cost of teaching. The quality and quantity of teaching cannot always be promoted in this respect. The traditional teaching methods can not respond well to the needs of the future. Therefore, this research aims to the following topics; (1). Propose the teaching strategies for the students to learning machining processing planning through Web-based learning system. (2). Establish on-line teaching material for the computer-aided manufacturing courses including CNC coding method, CNC simulation. (3). Develop the virtual machining laboratory to bring the machining practical training to Web-based learning system. (4).

Different studies have described the use of two-class machine learning to predict microRNAs (miRNAs) gene target. Most of these methods require the generation of an artificial negative class. However, designation of the negative class can be problematic and if it is not properly done can affect the performance of the classifier dramatically and/or yield a biased estimate of performance. We present study using one-class machine learning for miRNA target discovery and compare one-class to two-class approaches using a zero-norm for feature selection. The usage of this simple feature selection cause an improving of the one-class results, where in some cases reaches the performance of the two-class approach. Of all the one-class methods tested based on the all features, we found that most of them gave similar accuracy that range from 0.81 to 0.89 while the two-class gave 0.93-0.99 accuracy. Interestingly, using zero-norm feature selection improves the results to reach accuracy of about 0.96. One and two class methods can both give useful classification accuracies. The advantage of one class methods is that they don't require any additional effort for choosing the best way of generating the negative class. In these cases one-class methods can be superior to two-class methods when the features which are chosen as representative of that positive class are well defined.&&&&&Machine learning,Object detection,Sequences,Machine learning algorithms,RNA,Humans,Computer science,Degradation,Genomics,Bioinformatics$$$$$bioinformatics,feature extraction,learning (artificial intelligence),molecular biophysics,organic compounds$$$$$zero norm feature selection,one class machine learning,microRNA target detection,computational biology,two class machine learning,miRNA gene target,artificial negative class,miRNA target discovery$$$$$microRNA,one-class,two-class,machine learning,feature selection
