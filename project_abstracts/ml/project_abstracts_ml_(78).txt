Identifying Chinese personal names based on Support Vector Machines and transformation-based error-driven learning&&&&&Recognition of Chinese personal name is emphasis and difficulty for unknown words recognition. If the problem is effectively solved, then it will improve the precision of unknown words recognition. The paper presents a method of Chinese name recognition based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) and transformation-based error-driven learning. Using the transformation-based learning approach to correct the identification results of SVM. Transformation rules effectively deal with the special cases of language phenomenon and improve the performance of SVM. Experiments show that the method is efficient in identifying person names from Chinese texts. In open test, the precision, recall, and F-measure are improved.&&&&&Support vector machines,Machine learning,Learning systems,Space technology,Text recognition,Hidden Markov models,Error correction,Mechatronics,Automation,Computer errors$$$$$learning (artificial intelligence),natural languages,support vector machines,text analysis$$$$$Chinese personal name identification,support vector machines,transformation-based error-driven learning,unknown words recognition$$$$$Chinese names recognition,support vector machines,transformation-based error-driven learning
