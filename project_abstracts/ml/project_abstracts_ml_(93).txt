Facial expression recognition system using machine learning&&&&&This paper proposes a novel facial expression recognition system based on image features. There are two main processes in the proposed system, which are face detection and facial expression recognition (FER). The face detection process uses Haar-like features, and the region of interest is reset to reduce the variable of appearance changes. The FER process extracts histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) features from each facial region, and then, support vector machine is performed to classify the final facial expression. In the experimental results, the system exactly recognized the facial expression of a certain person, and the proposed system had the F1 score of 0.8759.&&&&&Feature extraction,Face recognition,Support vector machines,Face detection,Image recognition,Machine learning$$$$$emotion recognition,face recognition,feature extraction,learning (artificial intelligence),support vector machines$$$$$machine learning,image features,face detection process,Haar-like features,FER process,facial region,support vector machine,facial expression recognition system,region of interest,HOG features,histogram of oriented gradients features$$$$$machine learning,supervised learning,facial expression recognition
