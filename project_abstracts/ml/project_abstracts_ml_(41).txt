The Construction of Undergraduate Machine Learning Course in the Artificial Intelligence Era&&&&&Machine learning technology has been greatly developed in the last decade, which makes artificial intelligence reach a revolutionary breakthrough and lets us really perceive the potential of artificial intelligence in changing human life. In order to improve the understanding and application ability of artificial intelligence, carrying out the corresponding machine learning course is of significance for the students during the undergraduate period. This paper probes into the teaching content, teaching form and other aspects of the undergraduate machine learning course based on this issue and proposes a teaching method driven by application scenarios to guide the undergraduate students to understand the development, current situation and frontier technology of machine learning. In the experimental design, the students' theoretical knowledge is fully considered, the practical questions are simplified, and the students' ability to think and solve problems is also raised, so as to lay a theoretical and practical basis for further study of machine learning.&&&&&Machine learning,Machine learning algorithms,Classification algorithms,Prediction algorithms,Education,Decision trees$$$$$artificial intelligence,computer aided instruction,computer science education,educational courses,further education,learning (artificial intelligence),teaching$$$$$artificial intelligence era,machine learning technology,undergraduate period,undergraduate students,undergraduate machine learning course,machine learning course,teaching content,teaching form$$$$$artificial intelligence,machine learning,undergraduate
