Optimizing Kernel Functions Using Transfer Learning from Unlabeled Data&&&&&In this paper, we propose an approach to learn the kernel which uses transferred knowledge from unlabeled data to cope with situations where training examples are scarce. In our approach, unlabeled data has been used to construct an optimized kernel that better generalizes on the target dataset. For the proposed kernel learning algorithm, Fisher Discriminant Analysis (FDA) is used in conjunction with Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) test of statistics to optimize a base kernel using labeled and unlabeled data. Thereafter, the constructed kernel from both labeled and unlabeled datasets is used in SVM to evaluate the results which proved to increase prediction accuracy.&&&&&Kernel,Machine learning,Support vector machines,Machine learning algorithms,Computer vision,Training data,Supervised learning,Testing,Machine vision,Algorithm design and analysis$$$$$learning (artificial intelligence),statistical analysis,support vector machines$$$$$kernel learning algorithm,Fisher discriminant analysis,maximum mean discrepancy,unlabeled data learning,support vector machine,transfer learning$$$$$Machine Learning,Kernel Methods,Learning the Kernels,Support Vector Machine (SVM),Transfer Learning
