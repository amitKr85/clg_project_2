Remote Operation System Detection Base on Machine Learning&&&&&A machine learning method for remote operation system recognition through their detection signatures with support vector machine (SNM) is proposed. A vector space model of Nmap fingerprint database and techniques for translating the host responses to SVM input vectors are also suggested. Experimental result on identification of signatures in the fingerprint database of Nmap 4.90RC1 but not known for Nmap 4.76 show that our method is effective in the discovery of new signatures not included in current fingerprint database.&&&&&Machine learning,Fingerprint recognition,Support vector machines,Support vector machine classification,Databases,Space technology,Learning systems,Protocols,Computer science,Educational institutions$$$$$digital signatures,learning (artificial intelligence),operating systems (computers),support vector machines$$$$$remote operation system detection,machine learning,detection signatures,support vector machine,vector space model,Nmap fingerprint database,SVM input vectors,signature identification,Nmap 4.90RC1,Nmap 4.76$$$$$OS detection,OS fingerprint,machine learning,support vector machine
