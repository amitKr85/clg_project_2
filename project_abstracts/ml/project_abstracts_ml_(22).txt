Unauthorized Access Point Detection Using Machine Learning Algorithms for Information Protection&&&&&With the frequent use of Wi-Fi and hotspots that provide a wireless Internet environment, awareness and threats to wireless AP (Access Point) security are steadily increasing. Especially when using unauthorized APs in company, government and military facilities, there is a high possibility of being subjected to various viruses and hacking attacks. It is necessary to detect unauthorized Aps for protection of information. In this paper, we use RTT (Round Trip Time) value data set to detect authorized and unauthorized APs in wired / wireless integrated environment, analyze them using machine learning algorithms including SVM (Support Vector Machine), C4.5, KNN (K Nearest Neighbors) and MLP (Multilayer Perceptron). Overall, KNN shows the highest accuracy.&&&&&Classification algorithms,Support vector machines,Wireless communication,Machine learning algorithms,Machine learning,Prediction algorithms,Wireless fidelity$$$$$computer network security,learning (artificial intelligence),multilayer perceptrons,support vector machines,wireless LAN$$$$$wireless AP security,military facilities,hacking attacks,RTT value data,wireless integrated environment,machine learning algorithms,Support Vector Machine,unauthorized Access Point detection,information protection,Wi-Fi,wireless Internet environment$$$$$detection, unauthorized AP, machine learning, protection
