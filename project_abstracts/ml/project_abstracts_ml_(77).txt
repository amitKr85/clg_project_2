An inexact reasoning algorithm based on interaction with fuzzy rule matrix transformation&&&&&This paper presents a reasoning algorithm based on interaction with fuzzy rule matrix transformation, and applies it to completing the patterns. Then the new full patterns will be used in training and synthetic judgment. The investigation shows that the method is effective and may be widely used in reasoning with incomplete knowledge.&&&&&Fuzzy reasoning,Knowledge based systems,Machine learning,Cybernetics,Machine learning algorithms,Production,Fuzzy logic,Fuzzy systems,Extraterrestrial measurements,Computational intelligence$$$$$fuzzy reasoning,fuzzy set theory,knowledge representation,matrix algebra$$$$$inexact reasoning algorithm,fuzzy rule matrix transformation,pattern completion,synthetic judgment,incomplete knowledge,knowledge representation$$$$$Fuzzy measure,Interaction,Fuzzy integral,Fuzzy rule matrix transformation,Inexact reasoning algorithm
