Soft sensor of glutamate concentration using extreme learning machine&&&&&Soft sensors have been widely used in biochemical process to estimate process variables that are difficult to measure online. In this paper, glutamate concentration is an important parameter of product quality for fermentation process, soft sensor was used to estimate glutamate concentration. In order to realizing real-time measurement of glutamate concentration, firstly analysing fermentation working principle and major factor, soft-sensor based on extreme learning machine was set up to predict glutamate concentration, then, the soft measurement model is compared to soft-sensor based on support vector machine, the learning capacity and generalization performance is also tested, the experimental results show that the application of extreme learning machine has a better ability to prediction glutamate concentration.&&&&&Support vector machines,Process control,Chemical engineering,Computers,Biomass,Artificial neural networks,Computational modeling$$$$$biotechnology,fermentation,learning (artificial intelligence),product quality,production engineering computing,support vector machines$$$$$soft sensor,glutamate concentration,extreme learning machine,biochemical process,product quality,fermentation process,soft measurement model,support vector machine,learning capacity,generalization performance$$$$$glutamate fermentation,extreme learning machine,soft-sensor,support vector machine
