Automatic Recognition of Books Based on Machine Learning&&&&&The content-based image recognition is a research focus in the field of computer vision. Machine learning especially deep learning has a great potential in the field of image recognition. This paper adopts the support vector machine algorithm and deep learning method convolutional neural network to recognize books in the digital image library and compares their performance. Experiments show that both methods used in this paper realize a fast and efficient image classification and help improve the intelligence of books retrieval.&&&&&Image recognition,Training,Support vector machines,Libraries,Image resolution,Machine learning,Feature extraction$$$$$content-based retrieval,digital libraries,electronic publishing,image classification,learning (artificial intelligence),neural nets,support vector machines$$$$$automatic recognition,books,machine learning,content-based image recognition,computer vision,support vector machine algorithm,deep learning method,convolutional neural network,digital image library,image classification$$$$$image recognition,recognition of books,support vector machine,deep learning
