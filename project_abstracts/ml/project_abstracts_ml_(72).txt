A sentiment analysis model for hotel reviews based on supervised learning&&&&&As the widespread use of computers and the high-speed development of the Internet, E-Commerce has already penetrated as a part of our daily life. For a popular product, there are a large number of reviews. This makes it difficult for a potential customer to make an informed decision on purchasing the product, as well as for the manufacturer of the product to keep track and to manage customer opinions. In this paper, we pay attention to online hotel reviews, and propose a supervised machine learning approach using unigram feature with two types of information (frequency and TF-IDF) to realize polarity classification of documents. As shown in our experimental results, the information of TF-IDF is more effective than frequency.&&&&&Machine learning,Presses,Support vector machines,Computational linguistics,Data mining,Semantics,Training$$$$$decision making,document handling,electronic commerce,hotel industry,Internet,learning (artificial intelligence),pattern classification,reviews$$$$$sentiment analysis model,computers,Internet,e-commerce,informed decision making,product purchasing,customer opinion management,online hotel reviews,supervised machine learning approach,unigram feature,document polarity classification,TF-IDF$$$$$Sentiment classification,supervised machine learning,Online reviews
