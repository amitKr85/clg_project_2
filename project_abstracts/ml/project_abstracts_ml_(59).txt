A New Support Vector Machine and Its Learning Algorithm&&&&&Support vector machine is a learning technique based on the structural risk minimization principle, this paper proposes a new kind of support vector machine (SVM), which modifies the classical SVM formulation to get even simpler dual optimization problem, then gives a quadratic optimization theorem, and according to it derives a multiplicative updates algorithm for solving the dual optimization problem. The updates algorithms converge monotonically to the solution of the optimal problem, and have a simple closed form. Experimental results of simulation indicate the feasibility of the varied regression support vector machine and its training algorithm&&&&&Support vector machines,Machine learning,EMP radiation effects,Risk management,Educational institutions,Information science,Intelligent control,Automation$$$$$learning (artificial intelligence),minimisation,quadratic programming,regression analysis,support vector machines$$$$$support vector machine,learning,structural risk minimization,dual optimization,quadratic optimization$$$$$learning algorithm,structural risk minimization principle,support vector machine
