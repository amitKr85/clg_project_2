Analysis of Machine learning Techniques Used in Behavior-Based Malware Detection&&&&&The increase of malware that are exploiting the Internet daily has become a serious threat. The manual heuristic inspection of malware analysis is no longer considered effective and efficient compared against the high spreading rate of malware. Hence, automated behavior-based malware detection using machine learning techniques is considered a profound solution. The behavior of each malware on an emulated (sandbox) environment will be automatically analyzed and will generate behavior reports. These reports will be preprocessed into sparse vector models for further machine learning (classification). The classifiers used in this research are k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Na√Øve Bayes, J48 Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (MlP). Based on the analysis of the tests and experimental results of all the 5 classifiers, the overall best performance was achieved by J48 decision tree with a recall of 95.9%, a false positive rate of 2.4%, a precision of 97.3%, and an accuracy of 96.8%. In summary, it can be concluded that a proof-of-concept based on automatic behavior-based malware analysis and the use of machine learning techniques could detect malware quite effectively and efficiently.&&&&&Malware,Machine learning,Accuracy,Support vector machine classification,Classification algorithms,Monitoring$$$$$Bayes methods,decision trees,Internet,invasive software,learning (artificial intelligence),multilayer perceptrons,pattern classification,support vector machines$$$$$machine learning,Internet,malware analysis,automated behavior-based malware detection,sparse vector model,k-nearest neighbors,kNN,J48 decision tree,support vector machine,SVM,Naive Bayes method,multilayer perceptron neural network,MLP neural nets$$$$$malware analysis,dynamic analysis,behavior analysis,data mining,machine learning,classification,malware detection
