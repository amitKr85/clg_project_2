A new method for shot gradual transiton detection using support vector machine&&&&&The detection of gradual transition is much more difficult than that of abrupt transition. In this paper, a new method for gradual transition detection that applies support vector machine is proposed. First, an improved variance projection function is introduced, and its practicality to the detection of gradual transition is analyzed as well. Then by using this variance projection function, the distance between the video frames is defined, and a method to calculate the feature vector of changes of the distance is proposed. Finally, a statistical learning method based on the support vector machine is devised to determine whether the changes of the distance are caused by gradual transition or not. The experiments results show that this method has better detection resolution and less timing complexity, and thus satisfactorily meets the requirements of real-time video-shot detection.&&&&&Gunshot detection systems,Support vector machines,Statistical learning,Timing,Video sequences,Artificial intelligence,Analysis of variance,Layout,Cameras,Feature extraction$$$$$video signal processing,learning (artificial intelligence),support vector machines,feature extraction$$$$$shot gradual transiton detection,support vector machine,variance projection function,video frames,distance change feature vector,statistical learning,video-shot detection,video similarity$$$$$Variance projection function,gradual transition detection,video similarity,support vector machine
