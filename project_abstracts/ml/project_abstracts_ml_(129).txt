Development of an Ontology of Learning Strategies and its Application to Generate Open Learner Models&&&&&The multi-strategy machine learning system (MSMLS) represents knowledge about each learning strategy and uses this to handle the learning strategy selection problem. This is used to model the student's learning strategy (mis)selection. Plausible justification trees are generated for the learning strategies, one of which is correct while the others lead to a mis-learning. The mistake by the student is traced back to either a mistake in the application of the subject knowledge or a mistake in the learnt knowledge. Learnt knowledge mistakes are traced to the inappropriate learning strategy being used. The trace through the wrong choice of learning strategy is 'opened' to the student. This will both, correct the particular error and help in changing the errors in the learning behavior of the student.&&&&&Ontologies,Machine learning,Learning systems,Application software,Problem-solving,Error correction,Computer applications,Buildings,Induction generators,Data structures$$$$$computer aided instruction,learning (artificial intelligence),ontologies (artificial intelligence),trees (mathematics)$$$$$open learner model,ontology,multistrategy machine learning system,student learning strategy selection,plausible justification trees$$$$$Machine learning,student modeling,open learner models
