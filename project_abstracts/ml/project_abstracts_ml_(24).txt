Instances selection for NN with fuzzy rough technique&&&&&The NN algorithm is a simple and well-known supervised learning scheme which classifies an unseen instance by finding its closest neighbor in training set. The main drawback of NN is that the whole training set must be stored in the computer to classify an unseen instance. In order to deal with this problem, P. Hart proposed the condensed nearest neighbor (CNN) algorithm. However, CNN select the important instances from the whole training set, which suffers from the problem of large memory requirement same as NN. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to select instances from the border region with fuzzy rough technique. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.&&&&&Machine learning,Accuracy,Training,Cybernetics,Classification algorithms,Rough sets,Testing$$$$$fuzzy set theory,learning (artificial intelligence),rough set theory$$$$$fuzzy rough technique,instances selection,NN algorithm,nearest neighbor rule,supervised learning scheme,condensed nearest neighbor algorithm$$$$$Instances selection,Nearest neighbor,Condensed nearest neighbor,Fuzzy rough set,Border region
