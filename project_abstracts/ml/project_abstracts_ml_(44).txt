A Malicious Attack on the Machine Learning Policy of a Robotic System&&&&&The field of robotics has matured using artificial intelligence and machine learning such that intelligent robots are being developed in the form of autonomous vehicles. The anticipated widespread use of intelligent robots and their potential to do harm has raised interest in their security. This research evaluates a cyberattack on the machine learning policy of an autonomous vehicle by designing and attacking a robotic vehicle operating in a dynamic environment. The primary contribution of this research is an initial assessment of effective manipulation through an indirect attack on a robotic vehicle using the Q learning algorithm for real-time routing control. Secondly, the research highlights the effectiveness of this attack along with relevant artifact issues.&&&&&Robots,Radiofrequency identification,Machine learning,Autonomous vehicles,Machine learning algorithms,Security$$$$$intelligent robots,learning (artificial intelligence),mobile robots,security of data$$$$$malicious attack,machine learning policy,robotic system,artificial intelligence,intelligent robots,autonomous vehicle,robotic vehicle,indirect attack,Q learning algorithm,real-time routing control,cyberattack$$$$$robotics, machine learning, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence
