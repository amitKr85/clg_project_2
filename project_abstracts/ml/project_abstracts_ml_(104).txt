Study of fault diagnosis model based on multi-class wavelet support vector machines&&&&&Compromising wavelet kernel and multi-class least squares support vector machines, this article put forward to a fault diagnosis model based on multi-class wavelet support vector machine. The model heightens auto-adaptive model classification ability by adjustment of scale parameter of wavelet kernel, and make use of remarkable learning ability and generalization ability of small sample of vector machines to improve speed and effectiveness of fault diagnosis. And taking fault diagnosis in heat-recycling system of thermal power plant as an example to analysis.&&&&&Fault diagnosis,Support vector machines,Support vector machine classification,Kernel,Mathematical model,Least squares methods,Machine learning,Power system modeling,Automation,Wavelet analysis$$$$$fault diagnosis,heat systems,thermal power stations,least squares approximations,pattern classification,wavelet transforms,learning (artificial intelligence),adaptive systems,generalisation (artificial intelligence),support vector machines$$$$$fault diagnosis,multiclass wavelet support vector machines,wavelet kernel,multiclass least squares support vector machine,autoadaptive model classification,learning,generalization,heat recycling system,thermal power plant$$$$$wavelet kernel,multi-class least squares support vector machines,fault diagnosis,heat-recycling system
