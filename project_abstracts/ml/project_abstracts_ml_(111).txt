Bounds on the rate of uniform convergence of learning processes with equality-expect noise samples on quasi-probability space&&&&&The bounds on the rate of uniform convergence of learning processes play an important role in the Statistical Learning Theory. They provide theoretical bases for the application of support vector machine and reflect the generalization ability of the learning machines. This paper mainly deals with the bounds on the rate of uniform convergence of learning processes when samples are corrupted by equality-expect noise on quasi-probability space.&&&&&Convergence,Statistical learning,Machine learning,Educational institutions,Probability,Cybernetics,Geology,Petroleum,Mathematics,Application software$$$$$learning (artificial intelligence),probability,support vector machines$$$$$uniform convergence rate,equality-expect noise samples,quasi-probability space,statistical learning theory,support vector machine,learning machines,learning processes uniform convergence$$$$$Quasi-probability,Equality-expect noise,Bounds on the rate of uniform convergence of learning processes
