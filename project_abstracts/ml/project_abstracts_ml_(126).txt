Implementation of machine learning for classifying prosthesis type through conventional gait analysis&&&&&Current forecasts imply a significant increase in the quantity of lower limb amputations. Synergizing the capabilities of a conventional gait analysis system and machine learning facilitates the capacity to classify disparate types of transtibial prostheses. Automated classification of prosthesis type may eventually advance rehabilitative acuity for selecting an appropriate prosthesis for a given aspect of the rehabilitation process. The presented research utilized a force plate as a conventional gait analysis device to acquire a feature set for two types of prosthesis: passive Solid Ankle Cushioned Heel (SACH) and the iWalk BiOM powered prosthesis. The feature set consists of both temporal and kinetic data with respect to the force plate signal during stance. Intuitively a passive prosthesis and powered prosthesis generate distinctively different force plate recordings. A support vector machine, which is type of machine learning application, achieves 100% classification between a passive prosthesis and powered prosthesis regarding the feature set derived from force plate recordings.&&&&&Prosthetics,Force,Support vector machines,Kinetic theory,Legged locomotion,Brakes,Context$$$$$gait analysis,learning (artificial intelligence),prosthetics$$$$$machine learning,prosthesis type classification,conventional gait analysis,lower limb amputations,transtibial prostheses,rehabilitative acuity,Solid Ankle Cushioned Heel,iWalk BiOM powered prosthesis$$$$$Powered Prosthesis,Gait Analysis,Force Plate,Support Vector Machine,Machine Learning$$$$$Amputees,Ankle,Ankle Joint,Artificial Limbs,Biomechanical Phenomena,Gait,Heel,Humans,Kinetics,Machine Learning,Prosthesis Design
