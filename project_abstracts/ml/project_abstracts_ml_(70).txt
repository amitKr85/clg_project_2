An empirical study of machine learning algorithms for cancer identification&&&&&Predicting cancer disease state is an important problem in the cancer discovery process. For example, discriminating between benign and malignant tumors improves the medical diagnosis of cancer. Although technological advancing led to the generation of data pertaining to patients with different disease states, evaluating the prediction performance of machine learning algorithms would be an important step. In this paper, we propose using machine learning algorithms such as a variant of AdaBoost, deepboost, xgboost and support vector machines and evaluate them using area under curve and accuracy on real clinical data related to thyroid cancer, colon cancer and liver cancer. Experimental results show the good performance of SVM.&&&&&Cancer,Machine learning algorithms,Support vector machines,Colon,Liver,Prediction algorithms,Standards$$$$$cancer,learning (artificial intelligence),liver,medical diagnostic computing,patient diagnosis,support vector machines,tumours$$$$$support vector machines,colon cancer,liver cancer,cancer identification,cancer disease state,cancer discovery process,benign tumors,malignant tumors,medical diagnosis,prediction performance,machine learning algorithms,xgboost,AdaBoost,deepboost,thyroid cancer$$$$$Boosting,Machine Learning,Cancer Genomics,Medical Diagnosis
