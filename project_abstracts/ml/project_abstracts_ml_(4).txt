A novel learning model-Kernel Granular Support Vector Machine&&&&&This paper presents a novel machine learning model-kernel granular support vector machine (KGSVM), which combines traditional support vector machine (SVM) with granular computing theory. By dividing granules and replacing with them in kernel space, the datasets can be reduced effectively without changing data distribution. And then the generalization performance and training efficiency of SVM can be improved. Simulation results on UCI datasets demonstrate that KGSVM is highly scalable for large datasets and very effective in terms of classification.&&&&&Machine learning,Support vector machines,Kernel,Quadratic programming,Support vector machine classification,Mathematical model,Machine learning algorithms,Cybernetics,Training data,Pattern recognition$$$$$learning (artificial intelligence),pattern classification,support vector machines$$$$$learning model-kernel granular support vector machine,machine learning model,granular computing theory,data distribution,UCI datasets,pattern classification$$$$$Kernel granular support vector machine,Support vector machine,Kernel space,Granules
