A machine-learning-based fault diagnosis approach for intelligent condition monitoring&&&&&We propose a machine-learning-based fault diagnosis approach for condition monitoring on the constant-speed rotating machines via vibration signals. There are mainly five phases in our approach, i.e., vibration signal measurement, discrete-wavelet-transformation-based preprocessing, feature extraction, base-line encoding, and fuzzy neural network. The advantage of this approach can identify the condition and faults of machine without sufficient diagnosis knowledge. Experimental results have demonstrated this approach is a useful tool for condition monitoring application.&&&&&Fault diagnosis,Vibrations,Frequency domain analysis,Fuzzy neural networks,Feature extraction,Discrete wavelet transforms,Vibration measurement$$$$$condition monitoring,discrete wavelet transforms,fault diagnosis,fuzzy neural nets,learning (artificial intelligence),mechanical engineering computing,vibration measurement$$$$$machine learning-based fault diagnosis approach,intelligent condition monitoring,constant-speed rotating machines,vibration signal measurement,discrete-wavelet-transformation-based preprocessing,feature extraction,base-line encoding,fuzzy neural network$$$$$Fault diagnosis,Condition monitoring,Machine learning,Fuzzy neural network,Discrete wavelet transformation
