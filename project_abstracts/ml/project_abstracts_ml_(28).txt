The concept learning in the theory of rough sets&&&&&Knowledge reduction in decision table is important in both theory and application, and it outputs a minimal algorithm as a result. Set of the samples fitting the minimal algorithm is a concept over the set of all possible instances. But in unfamiliar environment, decision table is obtained randomly. So the obtained concept is an approximation to a potential target concept. We discuss the model of this concept learning, sample complexity of its hypothesis space and PAC-learnability of its target concept class.&&&&&Complexity theory,Machine learning,Approximation algorithms,Presses,Training,Polynomials,Set theory$$$$$approximation theory,decision tables,learning (artificial intelligence),rough set theory$$$$$rough sets theory,knowledge reduction,decision table,PAC-learnability,concept learning$$$$$Rough Set,Concept Learning,Sample Complexity,PAC-Learnability
