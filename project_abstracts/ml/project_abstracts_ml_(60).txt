The failure analysis of extreme learning machine on big data and the counter measure&&&&&Extreme learning machine (ELM) for single-hidden layer feedforward neural networks (SLFNs) was known for its extremely fast learning speed while maintaining acceptable generalization. Unfortunately, the failure of ELM on big data occurs frequently. The course is, the main computation of ELM focus on the calculation of generalized inverse of hidden layer output matrix, which depends on singular value decomposition (SVD) and has very low efficiency especially on high order matrix. In view of this high calculation complexity directly courses the failure of ELM on big data, normal equation extreme learning machine is proposed, which use the normal equation to reduce the size of the matrix equation and overcome the failure. The experiments on benchmarks show that the new proposed model has better performance than the ELM, so as to have more potential for large scale data learning.&&&&&Big Data,failure analysis,feedforward neural nets,learning (artificial intelligence),matrix algebra,singular value decomposition$$$$$failure analysis,counter measure,extreme learning machine,ELM,single-hidden layer feedforward neural networks,SLFN,Big Data,hidden layer output matrix,singular value decomposition,SVD,high order matrix,high calculation complexity,normal equation,matrix equation,large scale data learning$$$$$Extreme learning machine,Generalized inverse,SVD,Normal equation
