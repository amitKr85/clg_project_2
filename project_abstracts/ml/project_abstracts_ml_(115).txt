Phishing web sites features classification based on extreme learning machine&&&&&Phishing are one of the most common and most dangerous attacks among cybercrimes. The aim of these attacks is to steal the information used by individuals and organizations to conduct transactions. Phishing websites contain various hints among their contents and web browser-based information. The purpose of this study is to perform Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) based classification for 30 features including Phishing Websites Data in UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository database. For results assessment, ELM was compared with other machine learning methods such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Na√Øve Bayes (NB) and detected to have the highest accuracy of 95.34%.&&&&&Phishing,Feature extraction,Uniform resource locators,Support vector machines,Machine learning,Mathematical model,Artificial neural networks$$$$$computer crime,learning (artificial intelligence),online front-ends,pattern classification,support vector machines,Web sites$$$$$support vector machine,Web browser,phishing Web sites feature classification,extreme learning machine-based classification,phishing Websites data,UC Irvine machine learning repository database,ELM,machine learning methods$$$$$Extreme Learning Machine,Features Classification,Information Security,Phishing
