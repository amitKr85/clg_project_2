Virtual Metrology in Semiconductor Manufacturing by Means of Predictive Machine Learning Models&&&&&Advanced Process Control (APC) is an important research area in Semiconductor Manufacturing (SM) to improve process stability crucial for product quality. In low-volume-high-mixture fabrication plants (fabs), Knowledge Discovery in Databases is extremely challenging due to complex technology mixtures and reduced availability of data for comparable process steps. High Density Plasma Chemical Vapor Deposition (HDP CVD) appears to be a process area in SM predestinated for application of Data Mining (DM). Enhancing physical metrology by predictive models leads to smart future fabs. Actual research focuses on Virtual Metrology (VM) using high sophisticated Machine Learning (ML) methods to model unknown functional interrelations and to predict the thickness of dielectric layers deposited onto a metallization layer of the manufactured wafers. Decision Trees (DT), Neural Networks (NN) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) have been investigated to maximize the accuracy of the regression. For data of various logistical granularities promising results have been achieved by implementing these statistical models.&&&&&Metrology,Accuracy,Predictive models,Artificial neural networks,Process control,Semiconductor device measurement,Manufacturing$$$$$data mining,decision trees,learning (artificial intelligence),neural nets,plasma CVD,process control,product quality,production engineering computing,regression analysis,semiconductor device metallisation,semiconductor industry,support vector machines$$$$$support vector regression,SVR,statistical models,NN,neural networks,DT,decision trees,metallization layer,dielectric layers,ML method,machine learning methods,VM,DM,data mining,HDP CVD,high density plasma chemical vapor deposition,databases,knowledge discovery,fabs,low-volume-high-mixture fabrication plants,product quality,SM,APC,advanced process control,predictive machine learning models,semiconductor manufacturing,virtual metrology$$$$$Virtual Metrology,Machine Learning,Support Vector Regression,Decision Trees,Neural Networks,Semiconductor Manufacturing,Advanced Process Control,Data Mining
