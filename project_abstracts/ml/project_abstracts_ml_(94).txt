Support Vector Machine for Classification Based on Fuzzy Training Data&&&&&Support vector machines (SVMs) have been very successful in pattern recognition and function estimation problems, but in the support vector machines for classification, the training examples are non-fuzzy input and output is y=plusmn1;. In this paper, we introduce the support vector machine in which the training examples are fuzzy input, and give some solving procedure of the support vector machine with fuzzy training data&&&&&Support vector machines,Support vector machine classification,Training data,Machine learning,Linear programming,Quadratic programming,Sun,Educational institutions,Electronic mail,Pattern recognition$$$$$fuzzy set theory,learning (artificial intelligence),pattern classification,support vector machines$$$$$support vector machine,SVM,pattern recognition,function estimation,pattern classification,fuzzy training data$$$$$Support vector machine,fuzzy training examples,possibility measure,fuzzy linear separable example,fuzzy chance constraint programming
