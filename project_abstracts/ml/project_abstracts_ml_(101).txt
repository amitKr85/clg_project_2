Support vector machine based on a new reduced samples method&&&&&The support vectors play an important role in the training to find the optimal hyper-plane. For the problem of many non-support vectors and a few support vectors in the classification of SVM, a method to reduce the samples that may be not support vectors is proposed in this paper. First, adopt the Support Vector Domain Description to find the smallest sphere containing the most data points, and then remove the objects outside the sphere. Second, remove the edge points based on the distance of each pattern to the centers of other classes. In comparison with the standard SVM, the experimental results show that the new algorithm in the paper is capable of reducing the number of samples as well as the training time while maintaining high accuracy.&&&&&Training,Accuracy,Classification algorithms,Kernel,Support vector machine classification,Machine learning$$$$$pattern classification,support vector machines$$$$$support vector machine,reduced samples method,optimal hyperplane,nonsupport vectors,SVM classification,support vector domain description,edge point$$$$$Support Vector Domain Description,Distance,Reduce
