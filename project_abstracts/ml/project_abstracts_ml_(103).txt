A Study and Application on Machine Learning of Artificial Intellligence&&&&&This thesis elaborated the concept, significance and main strategy of machine learning as well as the basic structure of machine learning system. By combining several basic ideas of main strategies, great effort are laid on introducing several machine learning methods, such as Rote learning, Explanation-based learning, Learning from instruction, Learning by deduction, Learning by analogy and Inductive learning, etc. Meanwhile, comparison and analysis are made upon their respective advantages and limitations. At the end of the article, it proposes the research objective of machine learning and points out its development trend.Machine learning is a fundamental way that enable the computer to have the intelligence ; Its application which had been used mainly the method of induction and the synthesis, rather than the deduction has already reached many fields of Artificial Intelligence.&&&&&Machine learning,Artificial intelligence,Learning systems,Application software,Humans,Computational modeling,Machine learning algorithms,Intelligent systems,Intelligent robots,Physiology$$$$$learning (artificial intelligence)$$$$$artificial intelligence,machine learning system,rote learning,explanation-based learning,learning from instruction,learning by deduction,learning by analogy,Inductive learning$$$$$machine learning,AI,system structure,learning strategy,algorithm
