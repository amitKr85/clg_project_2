Initiated language learning machine with multi-media and speech-recognition techniques&&&&&Facing the 21
st
century the age of exploration-increasing of all kinds of knowledge and quickly development of information, how to promote the competition potential of our citizens becomes a critical issue. How to deepen the quality of education obviously becomes an important mission for the government. As we know, the initial stage of children education is main portion of profound education work and ought to be carefully concerned. Parents should offer perfect educational environment as well as material environment for next generation instead of purchasing better living condition all day long. A well-learning attitude and habit should be cultivated from childhood, especially from the initial stage of children. For example, the learning age of children is provided earlier than before in most Asian countries to upgrade the best learning effect. Therefore, in this study we tried to combine advanced technology of speech-recognition techniques with Sun-Plus microprocessor SPCE061A with wireless communication technique of Bluetooth and Flash software to construct “Full-purposed Learning Machine for Initial stage education”, which posses techniques speech-recognition, wireless communication interface, and multi-media management, to offer an ever brand-new learning environment and experience for children. The experimental result of this brand-new learning machine with testing from 251 children finally proved that learning activities could achieve much better effect through encouraged design and attractive factors with multi-media and promote the interest for students to learn boring language.&&&&&Machine learning,Education,Pediatrics,Bluetooth,Wireless communication,Broadcasting,Receivers$$$$$Bluetooth,computer aided instruction,microprocessor chips,multimedia communication,speech recognition$$$$$initiated language learning machine,speech-recognition techniques,Sun-Plus microprocessor SPCE061A,wireless communication technique,Bluetooth,Flash software,children education$$$$$Full-purposed learning machine,Speech-recognition,Bluetooth,Multi-media
