Multi-output Support Vector Machine Regression and Its Online Learning&&&&&This paper introduces multi-output support vector machine regression (M-SVR) by using the re-weight iterative algorithm. Then the problem of online learning of M-SVR is solved by given the iterative formula for the weight of regression function using the gradient descent algorithm of instantaneous risk. Computer experiments show that the accuracy and workload of the algorithm are superior to that using several one-dimensional output SVRs algorithm.&&&&&Support vector machines,Machine learning,Iterative algorithms,Laboratories,Kernel,Computer science,Software engineering,Paper technology,Statistical learning,Hilbert space$$$$$learning (artificial intelligence),regression analysis,support vector machines$$$$$online learning,multi-output regression,support vector machine$$$$$support vector machine,multi-output regression,online learning
