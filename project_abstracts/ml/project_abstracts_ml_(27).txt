Information extraction from ultrawideband ground penetrating radar data: A machine learning approach&&&&&To detect and characterize pipes and cables buried in the ground and to track their course we propose a new approach, which consists of an ultrawideband radar system employed as Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) and a machine learning algorithm for the objects' hyperbola identification and evaluation directly in the recorded radargram.&&&&&Ground penetrating radar,Machine learning algorithms,Machine learning,Generators,Antenna measurements,Noise$$$$$ground penetrating radar,learning (artificial intelligence),radar detection,ultra wideband radar$$$$$information extraction,ultrawideband ground penetrating radar data,pipe detection,cable detection,machine learning algorithm,object hyperbola identification,radargram$$$$$Ground Penetrating Radar,Ultrawideband Radar,Buried Object Detection,Machine Learning Algorithms
