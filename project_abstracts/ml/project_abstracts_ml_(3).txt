Deep learning versus traditional machine learning methods for aggregated energy demand prediction&&&&&In this paper the more advanced, in comparison with traditional machine learning approaches, deep learning methods are explored with the purpose of accurately predicting the aggregated energy consumption. Despite the fact that a wide range of machine learning methods have been applied to probabilistic energy prediction, the deep learning ones certainly represent the state-of-the-art artificial intelligence methods with remarkable success in a spectrum of practical applications. In particular, the use of Multi Layer Perceptrons, recently enhanced with deep learning capabilities, is proposed. Furthermore, its performance is compared with the most commonly used machine learning methods, such as Support Vector Machines, Gaussian Processes, Regression Trees, Ensemble Boosting and Linear Regression. The analysis of the day-ahead energy prediction demonstrates that different prediction methods present significantly different levels of accuracy in the case of a challenging dataset that comprises an interesting mix of consumers, wind and solar generation. The results show that Multi Layer Perceptrons outperform all the eight methods used as a benchmark in this study.&&&&&Machine learning,Support vector machines,Buildings,Learning systems,Energy consumption,Wind forecasting$$$$$energy consumption,Gaussian processes,learning (artificial intelligence),multilayer perceptrons,power engineering computing,regression analysis,support vector machines$$$$$aggregated energy demand prediction,traditional machine learning approaches,deep learning methods,aggregated energy consumption,machine learning methods,probabilistic energy prediction,artificial intelligence methods,MultiLayer Perceptrons,deep learning capabilities,Support Vector Machines,day-ahead energy prediction,solar generation,wind generation$$$$$deep learning,energy consumption,energy prediction,forecasting,machine learning
