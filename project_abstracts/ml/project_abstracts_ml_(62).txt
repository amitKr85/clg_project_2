Unsupervised and Semi-Supervised Two-class Support Vector Machines&&&&&Support vector machines have been a dominant learning technique for almost ten years, moreover they have been applied to supervised learning problems. Recently two-class unsupervised and semi-supervised classification problems based on bounded c-support vector machines are relaxed to semi-definite programming (B.L. Xu et al., 2004). In this paper the authors present another version to two-class unsupervised and semi-supervised classification problems based on bounded v-support vector machines, which trained by convex relaxation of the training criterion: find a labeling that yield a maximum margin on the training data. But the problems have difficulty to compute, we will find their semi-definite relaxations that can approximate them well. Experimental results show that our new unsupervised and semi-supervised classification algorithms often obtain more accurate results than other unsupervised and semi-supervised methods&&&&&Support vector machines,Support vector machine classification,Machine learning,Classification algorithms,Quadratic programming,Educational institutions,Unsupervised learning,Data mining,Kernel,Supervised learning$$$$$classification,learning (artificial intelligence),support vector machines,unsupervised learning$$$$$bounded support vector machines,semi-definite programming,unsupervised learning,semi-supervised learning,convex relaxation,training data$$$$$Bounded Support Vector Machines,Semidefinite,Programming,unsupervised learning,semisupervised,learning,margin
