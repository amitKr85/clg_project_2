MAP hypothesis in Bayesian concept learning&&&&&Machine learning is applied to many fields. Bayesian reasoning is essential to machine learning, because it supports quantitative method for measuring confidence level of multiple hypotheses. This paper studies concept learning through using Bayesian theory. We first prove that every consistent hypothesis is maximum a posterior hypothesis (MAP hypothesis) under some proper assumption; then, under three different zero-mean noise distributions (Laplace distribution, uniform distribution, and normal distribution), we obtain the MAP hypothesis of output about one kind of machine learning problem.&&&&&Bayesian methods,Machine learning,Boolean functions,Birds,Artificial intelligence,Animals,Data mining,Machine learning algorithms,Information systems,Intelligent networks$$$$$learning (artificial intelligence),Bayes methods,maximum likelihood estimation,statistical distributions$$$$$MAP hypothesis,Bayesian concept learning,machine learning,Bayesian reasoning,confidence level,multiple hypotheses,Bayesian theory,maximum a posterior hypothesis,zero-mean noise distribution,consistent hypothesis$$$$$concept learning,Bayesian reasoning,consistent hypothesis,MAP hypothesis
