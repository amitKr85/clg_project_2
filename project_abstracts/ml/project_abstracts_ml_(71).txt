A Fast Learning Algorithm with Transductive Support Vector Machine&&&&&Transductive inference based on support vector machine is a new research region in statistical learning theory. An improved algorithm is proposed in this paper, which overcome the disadvantages of studying process complexity and slow in the progressive transductive support vector machine learning algorithm. The algorithm optimized the samples which near the support vector only, and large number of samples were reduced, so the speed of algorithm is improved. Experiments show that the speed of this algorithm is improved with little influence on the performance.&&&&&Machine learning,Support vector machines,Support vector machine classification,Machine learning algorithms,Inference algorithms,Laboratories,Nondestructive testing,Statistical learning,Pattern recognition,Learning systems$$$$$inference mechanisms,learning (artificial intelligence),statistical analysis,support vector machines$$$$$fast learning algorithm,transductive support vector machine,transductive inference,statistical learning theory,process complexity,machine learning
