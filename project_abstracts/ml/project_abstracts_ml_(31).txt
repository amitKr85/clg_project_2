Analyzing document logic structure by machine learning&&&&&Considering the analysis process of document logic structure, the paper defines gross information. Based on gross information, the analysis of document logic structure is implemented using the element property and relations between elements synthetically. At the same time, an offline inductive learning algorithm and an online GUI learning algorithm are used in the analysis process. As an experiment shows, this method is effective and can be used in practical applications.&&&&&Logic,Machine learning,Information analysis,Text analysis,Machine learning algorithms,Algorithm design and analysis,Natural language processing,Computer science,Graphical user interfaces,Sections$$$$$learning by example,natural languages,text analysis,graphical user interfaces$$$$$document logic structure,machine learning,gross information,offline inductive learning algorithm,online GUI learning algorithm,natural language processing
