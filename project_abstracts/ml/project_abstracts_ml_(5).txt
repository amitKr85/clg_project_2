The research of the parallel SMO algorithm for solving SVM&&&&&In order to improve solving support vector machine algorithm, an improved learning algorithm of the parallel SMO is proposed. According to this algorithm, the master CPU averagely distributes primitive training set to slave CPUs so that they can almost independently run serial SMO on their respective training set. As it adopts the strategies of buffer and shrink, the speed of the parallel training algorithm is increased, which is showed in the experiments of parallel SMO based on the dataset of MNIST. The experiments indicate that the parallel SMO algorithm has good performance in solving largescale SVM.&&&&&Support vector machines,Machine learning algorithms,Support vector machine classification,Machine learning,Kernel,Master-slave,Cybernetics,Pattern recognition,Large-scale systems,Probability density function$$$$$algorithm theory,learning (artificial intelligence),minimisation,support vector machines$$$$$parallel SMO algorithm,support vector machine algorithm,learning algorithm,master CPU,slave CPU,primitive training set,serial SMO,buffer,sequential minimal optimisation$$$$$Support Vector Machine,Learning algorithm,Parallel SMO
