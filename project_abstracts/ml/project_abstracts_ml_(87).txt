A new method for learning barriers diagnosis based on fuzzy rules&&&&&Some methods have been presented for diagnosing learning problems of learners for adaptive learning systems. In this paper, we present a new method to diagnose learning barriers based on fuzzy rules. The proposed method evaluates the learning degree and infers the probability of learning barriers of the learner based on fuzzy rules. It provides a useful way to diagnose the learning barriers of the learners in adaptive learning systems.&&&&&Accuracy,Probability,Machine learning,Adaptive systems,Fuzzy sets,Learning systems,Cybernetics$$$$$fuzzy logic,fuzzy set theory,learning systems,probability$$$$$learning barriers diagnosis,fuzzy rules,adaptive learning systems,learning barriers probability$$$$$Learning problems diagnosis,learning barriers analysis,learning barrier detection,learning guidance,fuzzy rules
