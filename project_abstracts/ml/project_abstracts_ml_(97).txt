Study of nonlinear system identification based on support vector machine&&&&&System identification plays an important role in control field. Support vector machine (SVM) is a novel machine learning method, and is powerful for the problem with small sample, nonlinearity, high dimension, and local minima. SVM has high generalization. In this paper, nonlinear system identification based on SVM was discussed and corresponding simulation was implemented. Cross validation method is used to select hyperparameter of SVM model. Good result indicates that SVM is effective tool for nonlinear system identification.&&&&&Nonlinear systems,Support vector machines,Support vector machine classification,Signal processing algorithms,Learning systems,Power system modeling,System identification,Control systems,Statistical learning,Lagrangian functions$$$$$nonlinear systems,identification,support vector machines,learning (artificial intelligence),generalisation (artificial intelligence)$$$$$nonlinear system identification,SVM model,support vector machine,machine learning method,generalization,cross validation method,hyperparameter selection
