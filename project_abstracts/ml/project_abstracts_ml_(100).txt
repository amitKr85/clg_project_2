Machine Learning Techniques Applied to Dynamic Video Adapting&&&&&In the past years, mobile devices were limited to textual content. However, the current generation has started to access richer multimedia content such as video, increasing the diversity of devices accessing the Web. Then, a problem arises as some of those devices characteristics like memory capacity or screen resolution turn the access to a content restricted. The present work considers the use of machine learning techniques as part of a dynamic video adaptation process, comparing the results from two of the most used approaches for data analysis, Multilayer Perceptron and Bayesian Inference, as part of a Decision Engine, analyzing data like device's capabilities, user's preferences and network condition in order to take the most appropriate way to adapt a video stream.&&&&&Machine learning,Streaming media,Bandwidth,Data analysis,Videoconference,Bayesian methods,Search engines,IPTV,Multilayer perceptrons,Computational efficiency$$$$$Bayes methods,data analysis,inference mechanisms,Internet,learning (artificial intelligence),mobile handsets,multilayer perceptrons,video signal processing,video streaming$$$$$machine learning techniques,dynamic video adapting,mobile devices,textual content,multimedia content,World Wide Web,memory capacity,screen resolution,content restricted,dynamic video adaptation process,data analysis,multilayer perceptron,Bayesian inference,decision engine,video stream$$$$$Video Adapting,Machine Learning,Neural Netqwork,Bayesian Inference,Ubiquitous Computing,Context-Aware Computing
