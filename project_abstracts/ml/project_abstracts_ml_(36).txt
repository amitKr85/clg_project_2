Semisupervised metric learning by kernel matrix adaptation&&&&&Many supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms depend on the choice of an appropriate distance metric. While metric learning for supervised (earning tasks has a long history, extending it to learning tasks with weaker supervisory information has only been studied very recently. In particular, several methods have been proposed for semi-supervised metric learning based on pairwise (dissimilarity information. In this paper, we propose a kernel-based approach for nonlinear metric learning, which performs locally linear translation in the kernel-induced feature space. We formulate the metric learning problem as a kernel learning problem and solve it efficiently by kernel matrix adaptation. Experimental results based on synthetic and real-world data sets show that our approach is promising for semi-supervised metric learning.&&&&&Kernel,Machine learning,Unsupervised learning,Supervised learning,Nearest neighbor searches,Clustering algorithms,Radial basis function networks,Learning systems,Computer science,Appropriate technology$$$$$unsupervised learning,pattern clustering$$$$$semisupervised metric learning,kernel matrix adaptation,unsupervised learning,distance metric,nonlinear metric learning,linear translation,clustering$$$$$metric learning,kernel learning,semi-supervised learning,clustering
