Optimal grouping by using Genetic Algorithm and Support Vector Machines&&&&&Nowadays with bloom of Internet technology, students can do their learning by digital learning platform even they are not in class. To diversify teaching and to improve effects in learning, many researchers strongly advocate cooperative learning and come out many essays in the field. When it comes to grouping, making group members help others, learning each other, and making students progressed in cooperative learning are prospective subjects. This investigation features collecting on-line learning processes and personal thinking styles of learners to select main characteristics influenced grouping by genetic algorithm. We also predict optimal grouping way which decided by support vector machine, one of machine learning. Finding best grouping model from varied characteristics helps teacher group easily and further the whole learning results in cooperative learning.&&&&&Genetic algorithms,Support vector machines,Support vector machine classification,Machine learning,Education,Internet,Biological cells,Information systems,Electronic learning,Artificial intelligence$$$$$computer aided instruction,genetic algorithms,Internet,learning (artificial intelligence),support vector machines$$$$$genetic algorithm,support vector machines,Internet technology,digital learning platform,teaching,cooperative learning,on-line learning processes,machine learning$$$$$Cooperative Learning,Genetic Algorithm,Support Vector Machines
