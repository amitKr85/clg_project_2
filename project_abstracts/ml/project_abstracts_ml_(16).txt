A kind of hybrid classification algorithm based on rough set and support vector machine&&&&&Support vector machine (SVM) is a new machine learning method and it has greater generalization performance. Rough set theory is a new effective tool in dealing with vagueness and uncertainty information. Integrating the advantages of two approaches, a kind of hybrid classification algorithm to efficiently extract classification rules is proposed in the paper. Moreover, a new kind of attribute reduction algorithm by constructing generalized decision information table is presented in the paper. Finally they are applied into handwritten Chinese recognition, and result shows the validity and feasibility of the algorithm suggested in the paper.&&&&&Classification algorithms,Support vector machines,Support vector machine classification,Set theory,Machine learning algorithms,Machine learning,Uncertainty,Data mining,Handwriting recognition,Equations$$$$$pattern classification,rough set theory,support vector machines,table lookup,learning (artificial intelligence),character recognition,knowledge engineering$$$$$support vector machine,rough set theory,generalized information table,hybrid classification algorithm,classification rules,attribute reduction algorithm,handwritten Chinese character recognition$$$$$Support Vector Machine,Rough Set Theory,Attribute Reduction,Generalized Information Table
