Hate speech detection in the Indonesian language: A dataset and preliminary study&&&&&The objective of our work is to detect hate speech in the Indonesian language. As far as we know, the research on this subject is still very rare. The only research we found has created a dataset for hate speech against religion, but the quality of this dataset is inadequate. Our research aimed to create a new dataset that covers hate speech in general, including hatred for religion, race, ethnicity, and gender. In addition, we also conducted a preliminary study using machine learning approach. Machine learning so far is the most frequently used approach in classifying text. We compared the performance of several features and machine learning algorithms for hate speech detection. Features that extracted were word n-gram with n=l and n=2, character n-gram with n=3 and n=4, and negative sentiment. The classification was performed using Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Bayesian Logistic Regression, and Random Forest Decision Tree. An F-measure of 93.5% was achieved when using word n-gram feature with Random Forest Decision Tree algorithm. Results also show that word n-gram feature outperformed character n-gram.&&&&&Feature extraction,Voice activity detection,Classification algorithms,Twitter,Machine learning,Machine learning algorithms,Support vector machines$$$$$Bayes methods,cultural aspects,decision trees,gender issues,learning (artificial intelligence),pattern classification,regression analysis,sentiment analysis,social networking (online),support vector machines,word processing$$$$$hate speech detection,Indonesian language,religion,machine learning algorithms,word n-gram feature,race,ethnicity,gender,feature extraction,negative sentiment,Naïve Bayes,text classification,Support Vector Machine,Bayesian Logistic Regression,Random Forest Decision Tree,social media,tweets dataset,Twitter$$$$$building dataset,classification,hate speech detection,machine learning
