An empirical performance comparison of machine learning methods for spam e-mail categorization&&&&&The increasing volume of unsolicited bulk e-mail (also known as spam) has generated a need for reliable antispam filters. Using a classifier based on machine learning techniques to automatically filter out spam e-mail has drawn many researchers' attention. In this paper, we review some of relevant ideas and do a set of systematic experiments on e-mail categorization, which has been conducted with four machine learning algorithms applied to different parts of e-mail. Experimental results reveal that the header of e-mail provides very useful information for all the machine learning algorithms considered to detect spam e-mail.&&&&&Learning systems,Unsolicited electronic mail,Electronic mail,Filters,Machine learning algorithms,Support vector machines,Machine learning,Support vector machine classification,Niobium,Filtering$$$$$learning (artificial intelligence),unsolicited e-mail,information filters$$$$$machine learning,unsolicited bulk e-mail,spam,antispam filters,e-mail categorization$$$$$spam,e-mail categorization,machine learning
